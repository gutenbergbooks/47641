<blockquote>

<p class="p7"><em>The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations.
Turnus sends to Diomedes. Æneas goes in person
to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives
him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son
Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms
for her son Æneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable
actions of his posterity.</em></p></blockquote>

  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> Turnus had assembled all his powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">His standard planted on Laurentum's towers,</div>
  <div class="i0">When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had given the signal of approaching war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had roused the neighing steeds to scour the fields,</div>
  <div class="i0">While the fierce riders clattered on their shields,</div>
  <div class="i0">Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">To join the allies, and headlong rush to war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,</div>
  <div class="i0">With bold Mezentius, who blasphemed aloud.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">These through the country took their wasteful course,</div>
  <div class="i0">The fields to forage, and to gather force.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Venulus to Diomede they send,</div>
  <div class="i0">To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Declare the common danger, and inform</div>
  <div class="i0">The Grecian leader of the growing storm:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Æneas, landed on the Latian coast,</div>
  <div class="i0">With banished gods, and with a baffled host,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet now aspired to conquest of the state,</div>
  <div class="i0">And claimed a title from the gods and fate;</div>
  <div class="i0">What numerous nations in his quarrel came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And how they spread his formidable name.</div>
  <div class="i0">What he designed, what mischiefs might arise,</div>
  <div class="i0">If fortune favoured his first enterprize,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And common interest, was involved in theirs."</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While Turnus and the allies thus urge the war,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.</div>
  <div class="i0">This way, and that, he turns his anxious mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thinks and rejects the counsels he designed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Explores himself in vain, in every part,</div>
  <div class="i0">And gives no rest to his distracted heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strike on the polished brass their trembling light,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">The glittering species here and there divide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cast their dubious beams from side to side;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to the cieling flash the glaring day.</div>
  <div class="i1">'Twas night; and weary nature lulled asleep</div>
  <div class="i0">The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Was laid on Tyber's banks, oppressed with grief,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And found, in silent slumber, late relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, through the shadows of the poplar wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Arose the father of the Roman flood;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">An azure robe was o'er his body spread,</div>
  <div class="i0">A wreath of shady reeds adorned his head:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, manifest to sight, the god appeared,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheered:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Undoubted offspring of etherial race,</div>
  <div class="i0">O long expected in this promised place!</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, through the foes, hast borne thy banished gods,</div>
  <div class="i0">Restored them to their hearths, and old abodes&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">This is thy happy home, the clime where fate</div>
  <div class="i0">Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.</div>
  <div class="i0">And that this nightly vision may not seem</div>
  <div class="i0">The effect of fancy, or an idle dream,</div>
  <div class="i0">A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,</div>
  <div class="i0">All white herself, and white her thirty young.</div>
  <div class="i0">When thirty rolling years have run their race,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which from this omen shall receive the name.</div>
  <div class="i0">Time shall approve the truth.&mdash;For what remains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And how with sure success to crown thy pains,</div>
  <div class="i0">With patience next attend. A banished band,</div>
  <div class="i0">Driven with Evander from the Arcadian land,</div>
  <div class="i0">Have planted here, and placed on high their walls;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,</div>
  <div class="i0">Derived from Pallas, his great grandsire's name:</div>
  <div class="i0">But the fierce Latians old possession claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">With war infesting the new colony.</div>
  <div class="i0">These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.</div>
  <div class="i0">To thy free passage I submit my streams.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, when the setting stars are lost in day,</div>
  <div class="i0">To Juno's power thy just devotion pay;</div>
  <div class="i0">With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:</div>
  <div class="i0">Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">When thou return'st victorious from the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.</div>
  <div class="i0">The god am I, whose yellow water flows</div>
  <div class="i0">Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:</div>
  <div class="i0">Tyber my name&mdash;among the rolling floods,</div>
  <div class="i0">Renowned on earth, esteemed among the gods.</div>
  <div class="i0">This is my certain seat. In times to come,</div>
  <div class="i0">My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said; and plunged below. While yet he spoke,</div>
  <div class="i0">His dream Æneas and his sleep forsook.</div>
  <div class="i0">He rose, and, looking up, beheld the skies</div>
  <div class="i0">With purple blushing, and the day arise.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then water in his hollow palm he took</div>
  <div class="i0">From Tyber's flood, and thus the powers bespoke:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And father Tyber, in thy sacred bed</div>
  <div class="i0">Receive Æneas, and from danger keep.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,</div>
  <div class="i0">Conceals thy watery stores&mdash;where'er they rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, bubbling from below, salute the skies&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn</div>
  <div class="i0">Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,</div>
  <div class="i0">For this thy kind compassion of our woes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shalt share my morning song, and evening vows.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, oh! be present to thy people's aid,</div>
  <div class="i0">And firm the gracious promise thou hast made."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus having said, two galleys, from his stores,</div>
  <div class="i0">With care he chuses, mans, and fits with oars.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now on the shore the fatal swine is found&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Wonderous to tell!&mdash;She lay along the ground:</div>
  <div class="i0">Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;</div>
  <div class="i0">She white herself, and white her thirty young.</div>

  <div class="i0">The following night, and the succeeding day,</div>
  <div class="i0">Propitious Tyber smoothed his watery way:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He rolled his river back, and poised he stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.</div>
  <div class="i0">Shouts from the land give omen to their course,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the pitched vessels glide with easy force.</div>
  <div class="i0">The woods and waters wonder at the gleam</div>
  <div class="i0">Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.</div>
  <div class="i0">One summer's night and one whole day they pass</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.</div>
  <div class="i0">The fiery sun had finished half his race,</div>
  <div class="i0">Looked back, and doubted in the middle space,</div>
  <div class="i0">When they from far beheld the rising towers,</div>
  <div class="i0">The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bowers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.</div>
  <div class="i0">These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan saw, and turned his ships to shore.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas on a solemn day: the Arcadian states,</div>
  <div class="i0">The king and prince, without the city gates,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then paid their offerings in a sacred grove</div>
  <div class="i0">To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fat of entrails on his altar fries.</div>
  <div class="i1">But, when they saw the ships that stemmed the flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And glittered through the covert of the wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">They rose with fear, and left the unfinished feast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till dauntless Pallas re-assured the rest</div>
  <div class="i0">To pay the rites. Himself without delay</div>
  <div class="i0">A javelin seized, and singly took his way,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then gained a rising ground, and called from far:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your business here; and bring you peace or war?"</div>
  <div class="i0">High on the stern Æneas took his stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And held a branch of olive in his hand,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">While thus he spoke:&mdash;"The Phrygians' arms you see,</div>
  <div class="i0">Expelled from Troy, provoked in Italy</div>
  <div class="i0">By Latian foes, with war unjustly made&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">At first affianced, and at last betrayed.</div>
  <div class="i0">This message bear:&mdash;The Trojans and their chief</div>
  <div class="i0">Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief."</div>
  <div class="i0">Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">The youth replies:&mdash;"Whatever you require,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend,</div>
  <div class="i0">A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Embraced the stranger prince, and joined his hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Conducted to the grove, Æneas broke</div>
  <div class="i0">The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Best of the Greeks! to whom, by fate's command,</div>
  <div class="i0">I bear these peaceful branches in my hand&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Undaunted I approach you, though I know</div>
  <div class="i0">Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;</div>
  <div class="i0">From Atreus though your ancient lineage came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And both the brother kings your kindred claim;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your virtue, through the neighbouring nations blown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,</div>
  <div class="i0">Have led me hither, less by need than choice.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our father Dardanus, as fame has sung,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:</div>
  <div class="i0">Electra from the loins of Atlas came&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your sire is Mercury, whom long before</div>
  <div class="i0">On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was Atlas daughter, who sustains the sky.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus from one common source our streams divide;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ours is the Trojan, yours the Arcadian side.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Raised by these hopes, I sent no news before,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor asked your leave, nor did your faith implore;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.</div>
  <div class="i0">The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our host expelled, what farther force can stay</div>
  <div class="i0">The victor troops from universal sway?</div>
  <div class="i0">Then will they stretch their power athwart the land,</div>
  <div class="i0">And either sea from side to side command.</div>
  <div class="i0">Receive our offered faith, and give us thine;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ours is a generous and experienced line:</div>
  <div class="i0">We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;</div>
  <div class="i0">In council cautious, and in fields we dare."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said; and, while he spoke, with piercing eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Evander viewed the man with vast surprise&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Pleased with his action, ravished with his face;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then answered briefly, with a royal grace:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,</div>
  <div class="i0">In whom the features of thy father shine!</div>
  <div class="i0">How I recall Anchises! how I see</div>
  <div class="i0">His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!</div>
  <div class="i0">Long though it be, 'tis fresh within my mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">When Priam to his sister's court designed</div>
  <div class="i0">A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And through the Arcadian kingdom took his way.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, past a boy, the callow down began</div>
  <div class="i0">To shade my chin, and call me first a man.</div>
  <div class="i0">I saw the shining train with vast delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Priam's goodly person pleased my sight:</div>
  <div class="i0">But great Anchises, far above the rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">With awful wonder fired my youthful breast.</div>
  <div class="i0">I longed to join, in friendship's holy bands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.</div>
  <div class="i0">I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.</div>
  <div class="i0">He gave me, when at length constrained to go,</div>
  <div class="i0">A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,</div>
  <div class="i0">A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A vest embroidered, glorious to behold,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.</div>
  <div class="i0">The league you ask, I offer, as your right;</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With swift supplies you shall be sent away.</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now celebrate, with us, this solemn day,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whose holy rites admit no long delay.</div>
  <div class="i0">Honour our annual feast; and take your seat,</div>
  <div class="i0">With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus having said, the bowls (removed for fear)</div>
  <div class="i0">The youths replaced, and soon restored the cheer.</div>
  <div class="i0">On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:</div>
  <div class="i0">A maple throne, raised higher from the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Received the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,</div>
  <div class="i0">A lion's shaggy hide, for ornament, they spread.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The loaves were served in canisters; the wine</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In bowls; the priest renewed the rites divine:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Broiled entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, when the rage of hunger was repressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,</div>
  <div class="i0">From no vain fears or superstition spring,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, saved from danger, with a grateful sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">The labours of a god we recompense.</div>
  <div class="i0">See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;</div>
  <div class="i0">Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,</div>
  <div class="i0">How desert now it stands, exposed in air!</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas once a robber's den, inclosed around</div>
  <div class="i0">With living stone, and deep beneath the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,</div>
  <div class="i0">This hold, impervious to the sun, possessed.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The pavement ever foul with human gore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.</div>
  <div class="i0">Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Black clouds he belched, and flakes of livid fire.</div>
  <div class="i0">Time, long expected, eased us of our load,</div>
  <div class="i0">And brought the needful presence of a god.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arrived in triumph, from Geryon slain:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thrice lived the giant, and thrice lived in vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove</div>
  <div class="i0">Near Tyber's banks, to graze the shady grove.</div>
  <div class="i0">Allured with hope of plunder, and intent</div>
  <div class="i0">By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,</div>
  <div class="i0">The brutal Cacus, as by chance they strayed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Four oxen thence, and four fair kine, conveyed.</div>
  <div class="i0">And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,</div>
  <div class="i0">He dragged them backwards to his rocky den.</div>
  <div class="i0">The tracks averse a lying notice gave,</div>
  <div class="i0">And led the searcher backward from the cave.</div>
  <div class="i0">Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,</div>
  <div class="i0">To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.</div>
  <div class="i0">The beasts, who missed their mates, filled all around</div>
  <div class="i0">With bellowings, and the rocks restored the sound.</div>
  <div class="i0">One heifer, who had heard her love complain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Roared from the cave, and made the project vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,</div>
  <div class="i0">And tossed about his head his knotted oak.</div>
  <div class="i0">Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">He clomb, with eager haste, the aërial height.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;</div>
  <div class="i0">Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Confessed the god's approach. Trembling he springs,</div>
  <div class="i0">As terror had increased his feet with wings;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor stayed for stairs; but down the depth he threw</div>
  <div class="i0">His body, on his back the door he drew:</div>
  <div class="i0">(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains</div>
  <div class="i0">His father hewed it out, and bound with iron chains,)</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He broke the heavy links, the mountain closed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bars and levers to his foe opposed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;</div>
  <div class="i0">The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;</div>
  <div class="i0">Surveyed the mouth of the forbidden hold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And here and there his raging eyes he rolled.</div>
  <div class="i0">He gnashed his teeth; and thrice he compassed round</div>
  <div class="i0">With winged speed the circuit of the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pulled in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.</div>
  <div class="i0">A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,</div>
  <div class="i0">Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;</div>
  <div class="i0">Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,</div>
  <div class="i0">Here built their nests, and hither winged their flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">The leaning head hung threatening o'er the flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And nodded to the left. The hero stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Averse, with planted feet, and, from the right,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tugged at the solid stone with all his might.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus heaved, the fixed foundations of the rock</div>
  <div class="i0">Gave way; heaven echoed at the rattling shock.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tumbling, it choked the flood: on either side</div>
  <div class="i0">The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;</div>
  <div class="i0">The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,</div>
  <div class="i0">And trembling Tyber dived beneath his bed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The court of Cacus stands revealed to sight;</div>
  <div class="i0">The cavern glares with new-admitted light.</div>
  <div class="i0">So the pent vapours, with a rumbling sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,</div>
  <div class="i0">The gods with hate behold<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the nether sky:</div>
  <div class="i0">The ghosts repine at violated night,</div>
  <div class="i0">And curse the invading sun, and sicken at the sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">The graceless monster, caught in open day,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inclosed, and in despair to fly away,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Howls horrible from underneath, and fills</div>
  <div class="i0">His hollow palace with unmanly yells.</div>
  <div class="i0">The hero stands above, and from afar</div>
  <div class="i0">Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.</div>
  <div class="i0">He, from his nostrils and huge mouth, expires</div>
  <div class="i0">Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gathering, with each repeated blast, the night,</div>
  <div class="i0">To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">The wrathful god then plunges from above,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,</div>
  <div class="i0">There lights; and wades through fumes, and gropes his way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Half singed, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He squeezed his throat; he writhed his neck around,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And in a knot his crippled members bound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, from their sockets, tore his burning eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">Rolled on a heap, the breathless robber lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">The doors, unbarred, receive the rushing day,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thorough lights disclose the ravished prey.</div>
  <div class="i0">The bulls, redeemed, breathe open air agen.</div>
  <div class="i0">Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The wondering neighbourhood, with glad surprise,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beheld his shagged breast, his giant size,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguished eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">From that auspicious day, with rites divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">We worship at the hero's holy shrine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Potitius first ordained these annual vows:</div>
  <div class="i0">As priests, were added the Pinarian house,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who raised this altar in the sacred shade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid.</div>
  <div class="i0">For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:</div>
  <div class="i0">Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with deep draughts invoke our common god."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">This said, a double wreath Evander twined,</div>
  <div class="i0">And poplars black and white his temples bind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then brims his ample bowl. With like design</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Meantime the sun descended from the skies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the bright evening-star began to rise.</div>
  <div class="i0">And now the priests, Potitius at their head,</div>
  <div class="i0">In skins of beasts involved, the long procession led;</div>
  <div class="i0">Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">As custom had prescribed their holy bands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then with a second course the tables load,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with full chargers offer to the god.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Salii sing, and cense his altars round</div>
  <div class="i0">With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">One choir of old, another of the young,</div>
  <div class="i0">To dance, and bear the burden of the song.</div>
  <div class="i0">The lay records the labours, and the praise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the immortal acts of Hercules:</div>
  <div class="i0">First, how the mighty babe, when swathed in bands,</div>
  <div class="i0">The serpents strangled with his infant hands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,</div>
  <div class="i0">The &OElig;chalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Procured by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thy hands, unconquered hero, could subdue</div>
  <div class="i0">The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The triple porter of the Stygian seat,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, seized with fear, forgot his mangled meat.</div>
  <div class="i0">The infernal waters trembled at thy sight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thee, god! no face of danger could affright;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not huge Typhöeus, nor the unnumbered snake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Increased with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace</div>

  <div class="i0">Receive the grateful offerings which we pay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"</div>
  <div class="i0">In numbers thus they sung: above the rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.</div>
  <div class="i0">The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.</div>
  <div class="i0">The rites performed, the cheerful train retire.</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan passed, the city to survey,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pleasing talk beguiled the tedious way.</div>
  <div class="i0">The stranger cast around his curious eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">New objects viewing still with new surprise;</div>
  <div class="i0">With greedy joy inquires of various things,</div>
  <div class="i0">And acts and monuments of ancient kings.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus the founder of the Roman towers:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"These woods were first the seat of sylvan powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Nymphs and Fauns, and savage men, who took</div>
  <div class="i0">Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of labouring oxen, nor the shining share,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor arts of gain, nor what they gained to spare.</div>
  <div class="i0">Their exercise the chase; the running flood</div>
  <div class="i0">Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Saturn came, who fled the power of Jove,</div>
  <div class="i0">Robbed of his realms, and banished from above.</div>
  <div class="i0">The men, dispersed on hills, to towns he brought,</div>
  <div class="i0">And laws ordained, and civil customs taught,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Latium called the land where safe he lay</div>
  <div class="i0">From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.</div>
  <div class="i0">With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;</div>
  <div class="i0">And hence the golden times derived their name.</div>
  <div class="i0">A more degenerate and discoloured age</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians, came;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Saturn's empire often changed the name.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then kings&mdash;gigantic Tybris, and the rest&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">With arbitrary sway the land oppressed:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For Tyber's flood was Albula before,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.</div>
  <div class="i0">I last arrived, driven from my native home,</div>
  <div class="i0">By fortune's power, and fate's resistless doom.</div>
  <div class="i0">Long tossed on seas, I sought this happy land,</div>
  <div class="i0">Warned by my mother nymph, and called by heaven's command."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shewed the gate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since called Carmental by the Roman state;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where stood an altar, sacred to the name</div>
  <div class="i0">Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who to her son foretold the Ænean race,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then shews the forests, which, in after-times,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce Romulus, for perpetrated crimes,</div>
  <div class="i0">A sacred refuge made;&mdash;with this, the shrine</div>
  <div class="i0">Where Pan below the rock had rites divine;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then tells of Argus' death, his murdered guest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now roofed with gold, then thatched with homely reeds.</div>
  <div class="i0">A reverent fear (such superstition reigns</div>
  <div class="i0">Among the rude) even then possessed the swains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some god, they knew&mdash;what god, they could not tell&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw</div>
  <div class="i0">The mighty Thunderer with majestic awe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who shook his shield, and dealt his bolts around,</div>
  <div class="i0">And scattered tempests on the teeming ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Saturnia's and Janiculum's remains;</div>
  <div class="i0">And either place the founder's name retains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Discoursing thus together, they resort</div>
  <div class="i0">Where poor Evander kept his country court.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">They viewed the ground of Rome's litigious hall;</div>
  <div class="i0">(Once oxen lowed, where now the lawyers bawl,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, stooping, through the narrow gate they pressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,</div>
  <div class="i0">Received Alcides, then a conqueror.</div>
  <div class="i0">Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then underneath a lowly roof he led</div>

  <div class="i1">Now night had shed her silver dews around,</div>

  <div class="i0">Couched with her husband in his golden bed,</div>

  <div class="i0">"While cruel fate conspired with Grecian powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">To level with the ground the Trojan towers,</div>

  <div class="i0">Though much I owed to Priam's house, and more</div>
  <div class="i0">The danger of Æneas did deplore.</div>

  <div class="i0">The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,</div>

  <div class="i0">Long since, had you required my helpful hand,</div>

  <div class="i0">Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,</div>

  <div class="i0">Till, in her lap infused, he lay possessed</div>

  <div class="i0">Now when the night her middle race had rode,</div>

  <div class="i0">With yawning mouths, and with half-opened eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">They ply the distaff by the winking light,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to their daily labour add the night:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,</div>

  <div class="i0">Not less concerned, nor at a later hour,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rose from his downy couch the forging power.</div>
  <div class="i1">Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,</div>
  <div class="i0">Raised high on smoking rocks: and, deep below,</div>

  <div class="i0">The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,</div>

  <div class="i0">Hither the father of the fire, by night,</div>

  <div class="i0">The brethren beating, and the blows go round:</div>

  <div class="i0">Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:</div>
  <div class="i0">These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Consumed on mortals with prodigious waste.</div>
  <div class="i0">Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of winged southern winds and cloudy store</div>
  <div class="i0">As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;</div>

  <div class="i0">The rest refresh the scaly snakes, that fold</div>
  <div class="i0">The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.</div>
  <div class="i0">Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,</div>
  <div class="i0">With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.</div>
  <div class="i1">"My sons!" said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;</div>

  <div class="i0">He said. They set their former work aside,</div>
  <div class="i0">And their new toils with eager haste divide.</div>
  <div class="i0">A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And deadly steel, in the large furnace rolled;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,</div>
  <div class="i0">Alone sufficient to sustain the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Seven orbs within a spacious round they close:</div>
  <div class="i0">One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.</div>
  <div class="i0">The hissing steel is in the smithy drowned;</div>
  <div class="i0">The grot with beaten anvils groans around.</div>
  <div class="i0">By turns, their arms advance in equal time;</div>
  <div class="i0">By turns, their hands descend, and hammers chime.</div>
  <div class="i0">They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;</div>
  <div class="i0">The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.</div>
  <div class="i1">While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge</div>
  <div class="i0">Their labours thus, and ply the Æolian forge,</div>
  <div class="i0">The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.</div>
  <div class="i0">He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet</div>
  <div class="i0">Above his ankles; sandals sheath his feet:</div>
  <div class="i0">He sets his trusty sword upon his side,</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Two menial dogs before their master press'd.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Mindful of promised aid, he mends his pace,</div>
  <div class="i0">But meets Æneas in the middle space.</div>
  <div class="i0">Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,</div>

  <div class="i0">"Undaunted prince! I never can believe</div>

  <div class="i0">The living and the dead, at his command,</div>

  <div class="i0">Till, choked with stench, in loathed embraces tied,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lingering wretches pined away and died.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus plunged in ills, and meditating more&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The people's patience, tried, no longer bore</div>

  <div class="i0">The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.</div>
  <div class="i0">The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,</div>

  <div class="i0">The first inhabitants, of Grecian blood,</div>

  <div class="i0">Not far from hence, along the river's side,</div>
  <div class="i0">In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,</div>
  <div class="i0">By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas cast his wondering eyes around,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stretched on the spacious plain from left to right.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thither his warlike train the Trojan led,</div>
  <div class="i0">Refreshed his men, and wearied horses fed.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime the mother goddess, crowned with charms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Breaks through the clouds, and brings the fated arms.</div>
  <div class="i0">Within a winding vale she finds her son,</div>
  <div class="i0">On the cool river's banks, retired alone.</div>
  <div class="i0">She shews her heavenly form without disguise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And gives herself to his desiring eyes.</div>

  <div class="i0">She said: and, having first her son embraced,</div>
  <div class="i0">The radiant arms beneath an oak she placed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Proud of the gift, he rolled his greedy sight</div>
  <div class="i0">Around the work, and gazed with vast delight.</div>
  <div class="i0">He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires</div>
  <div class="i0">The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:</div>

  <div class="i0">Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;</div>
  <div class="i0">So shines a cloud, when edged with adverse light.</div>
  <div class="i0">He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try</div>
  <div class="i0">The plaited cuishes on his manly thigh;</div>
  <div class="i0">But most admires the shield's mysterious mould,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:</div>

  <div class="i0">(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)</div>

  <div class="i0">They sucked secure, while, bending back her head,</div>
  <div class="i0">She licked their tender limbs, and formed them as they fed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games</div>
  <div class="i0">Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.</div>
  <div class="i0">The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,</div>
  <div class="i0">For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.</div>

  <div class="i0">There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,</div>

  <div class="i0">Their king, half threatening, half disdaining, stood,</div>

<p>This similitude is literally taken from Apollonius Rhodius; and
it is hard to say whether the original or the translation excels.
But, in the shield which he describes afterwards in this Æneïd, he
as much transcends his master Homer, as the arms of Glaucus
were richer than those of Diomedes&mdash;Χρυσεα χαλχειων.</p>

<p><em>Turnus takes advantage of Æneas's absence, fires some of his ships,
(which are transformed into sea-nymphs,) and assaults his camp.

  <div class="i0">The various Iris Juno sends with haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,</div>
  <div class="i0">The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.</div>
  <div class="i0">Retired alone she found the daring man,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oped her rosy lips, and thus began:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, gone to seek the Arcadian prince,</div>
  <div class="i0">Has left the Trojan camp without defence;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, short of succours there, employs his pains</div>
  <div class="i0">In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.</div>

  <div class="i0">This said, on equal wings she poised her weight,</div>

  <div class="i1">The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Iris, the grace of heaven! what power divine</div>
  <div class="i0">Has sent thee down, through dusky clouds to shine?</div>
  <div class="i0">See, they divide: immortal day appears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And glittering planets dancing in their spheres!</div>
  <div class="i0">With joy, these happy omens I obey,</div>

  <div class="i1">Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">He scooped the water from the crystal flood;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then with his hands the drops to heaven he throws,</div>
  <div class="i0">And loads the powers above with offered vows.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now march the bold confederates through the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Well horsed, well clad&mdash;a rich and shining train.</div>
  <div class="i0">Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.</div>
  <div class="i0">In the main battle, with his flaming crest,</div>
  <div class="i0">The mighty Turnus towers above the rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Silent they move, majestically slow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the dark menace of the distant war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Caïcus from the rampire saw it rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Blackening the fields, and thickening through the skies.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?</div>
  <div class="i0">Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus warned, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend</div>
  <div class="i0">The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:</div>
  <div class="i0">For their wise general, with foreseeing care,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had charged them not to tempt the doubtful war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor, though provoked, in opens fields advance,</div>
  <div class="i0">But close within their lines attend their chance.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A piebald steed of Thracian strain he pressed;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His helm of massy gold; and crimson was his crest.</div>
  <div class="i0">With twenty horse to second his designs,</div>
  <div class="i0">An unexpected foe, he faced the lines.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Is there, (he said,) in arms, who bravely dare</div>
  <div class="i0">His leader's honour and his dangers share?"</div>
  <div class="i0">Then spurring on, his brandished dart he threw,</div>
  <div class="i0">In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.</div>
  <div class="i1">Amazed to find a dastard race, that run</div>
  <div class="i0">Behind the rampires, and the battle shun,</div>
  <div class="i0">He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And stops at every post, and every passage tries.</div>
  <div class="i0">So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:</div>
  <div class="i0">Wet with descending showers, and stiff with cold,</div>
  <div class="i0">He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,</div>
  <div class="i0">(His gnashing teeth are exercised in vain,)</div>
  <div class="i0">And, impotent of anger, finds no way</div>
  <div class="i0">In his distended paws to grasp the prey.</div>
  <div class="i0">The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs</div>
  <div class="i0">Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">To force his foes in equal field to fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, fenced with strong redoubts, their navy lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">Close underneath the walls: the washing tide</div>
  <div class="i0">Secures from all approach this weaker side.</div>
  <div class="i0">He takes the wished occasion, fills his hand</div>
  <div class="i0">With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Urged by his presence, every soul is warmed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every hand with kindled fires is armed.</div>
  <div class="i0">From the fired pines the scattering sparkles fly;</div>
  <div class="i0">Fat vapours, mixed with flames, involve the sky.</div>

  <div class="i0">What power, O Muses, could avert the flame,</div>

  <div class="i0">And felled his timber from mount Ida's height,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Grandame goddess then approached her son,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a mother's majesty begun:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Grant me (she said) the sole request I bring,</div>
  <div class="i0">Since conquered heaven has owned you for its king.</div>
  <div class="i0">On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">With firs and maples filled, a shady wood;</div>
  <div class="i0">And on the summit rose a sacred grove,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where I was worshipped with religious love.</div>
  <div class="i0">These woods, that holy grove, my long delight,</div>
  <div class="i0">I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, filled with fear, on their behalf I come;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb,</div>
  <div class="i0">The floating forests of the sacred pine;</div>
  <div class="i0">But let it be their safety to be mine."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls</div>
  <div class="i0">The radiant stars, and heaven and earth controuls:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"How dare you, mother, endless date demand</div>
  <div class="i0">For vessels moulded by a mortal hand?</div>
  <div class="i0">What then is fate? Shall bold Æneas ride,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of safety certain, on the uncertain tide?</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, what I can, I grant: when, wafted o'er,</div>
  <div class="i0">The chief is landed on the Latian shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever ships escape the raging storms,</div>
  <div class="i0">At my command shall change their fading forms</div>
  <div class="i0">To nymphs divine, and plough the watery way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like Doto and the daughters of the sea."</div>
  <div class="i1">To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the black regions of his brother god.</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">And now at length the numbered hours were come,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prefixed by fate's irrevocable doom,</div>
  <div class="i0">When the great mother of the gods was free</div>
  <div class="i0">To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.</div>
  <div class="i0">First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung</div>
  <div class="i0">A light that signed the heavens, and shot along;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then from a cloud, fringed round with golden fires,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Both hosts, in arms opposed, with equal horror wounds:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O Trojan race! your needless aid forbear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And know, my ships are my peculiar care.</div>
  <div class="i0">With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,</div>
  <div class="i0">With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,</div>
  <div class="i0">Loosed from your crooked anchors, launch at large,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."</div>
  <div class="i0">No sooner had the goddess ceased to speak,</div>
  <div class="i0">When, lo! the obedient ships their halsers break;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main</div>
  <div class="i0">They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:</div>
  <div class="i0">As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,</div>
  <div class="i0">As rode before tall vessels on the deep.</div>
  <div class="i0">The foes, surprised with wonder, stood aghast;</div>
  <div class="i0">Messapus curbed his fiery courser's haste:</div>
  <div class="i0">Old Tyber roared, and, raising up his head,</div>
  <div class="i0">Called back his waters to their oozy bed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,</div>
  <div class="i0">And are by Jove for black presages sent.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He takes the cowards' last relief away;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For fly they cannot, and, constrained to stay,</div>

  <div class="i0">The liquid half of all the globe is lost;</div>
  <div class="i0">Heaven shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.</div>
  <div class="i0">Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground,</div>

  <div class="i0">Their feats I fear not, or vain oracles.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas given to Venus they should cross the seas,</div>

  <div class="i0">My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,</div>

  <div class="i0">Was't not enough, that, punished for the crime,</div>

  <div class="i0">Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;</div>
  <div class="i0">The morn shall end the small remains of war."</div>
  <div class="i1">The post of honour to Messapus falls,</div>
  <div class="i0">To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,</div>
  <div class="i0">To pitch the fires at distances around,</div>
  <div class="i0">And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;</div>
  <div class="i0">All clad in shining arms the works invest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Stretched at their length, they press the grassy ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)</div>
  <div class="i0">With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with armed legions all the rampires filled.</div>
  <div class="i0">Seized with affright, their gates they first explore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Join works to works with bridges, tower to tower:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus all things needful for defence abound:</div>
  <div class="i0">Mnestheus and brave Serestus walk the round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Commissioned by their absent prince to share</div>
  <div class="i0">The common danger, and divide the care.</div>
  <div class="i0">The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">By turns relieve each other on the wall.</div>
  <div class="i1">Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,</div>
  <div class="i0">To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.</div>
  <div class="i0">His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;</div>
  <div class="i0">His mother was a huntress of the wood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear</div>
  <div class="i0">His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,</div>
  <div class="i0">But better skilled unerring shafts to send.</div>
  <div class="i0">Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host</div>
  <div class="i0">No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.</div>
  <div class="i0">One was their care, and their delight was one.</div>
  <div class="i0">One common hazard in the war they shared,</div>
  <div class="i0">And now were both by choice upon the guard.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Nisus thus:&mdash;"Or do the gods inspire</div>
  <div class="i0">This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?</div>
  <div class="i0">A generous ardour boils within my breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Eager of action, enemy to rest:</div>
  <div class="i0">This urges me to fight, and fires my mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">To leave a memorable name behind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou seest the foe secure; how faintly shine</div>
  <div class="i0">Their scattered fires: the most, in sleep supine</div>
  <div class="i0">Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:</div>
  <div class="i0">The wakeful few the fuming flaggon ply:</div>
  <div class="i0">All hushed around. Now hear what I revolve&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A thought unripe&mdash;and scarcely yet resolve.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;</div>
  <div class="i0">By message both would hasten his return:</div>
  <div class="i0">If they confer what I demand on thee,</div>
  <div class="i0">(For fame is recompense enough for me,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied</div>
  <div class="i0">A way that safely will my passage guide."</div>
  <div class="i0">Euryalus stood listening while he spoke;</div>
  <div class="i0">With love of praise, and noble envy struck;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then to his ardent friend exposed his mind:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be joined?</div>
  <div class="i0">Think'st thou I can my share of glory yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or send thee unassisted to the field?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not so my father taught my childhood arms&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Born in a siege, and bred among alarms.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor of the heaven born hero I attend.</div>
  <div class="i0">The thing, called life, with ease I can disclaim,</div>
  <div class="i0">And think it over-sold to purchase fame."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Nisus thus:&mdash;"Alas! thy tender years</div>
  <div class="i0">Would minister new matter to my fears.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Restore me to thy loved embrace with life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Condemned to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)</div>
  <div class="i0">This thy request is cruel and unjust.</div>
  <div class="i0">But if some chance&mdash;as many chances are,</div>
  <div class="i0">And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">If one should reach my head, there let it fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">And spare thy life; I would not perish all.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:</div>
  <div class="i0">Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">To bear my mangled body from the foe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or buy it back, and funeral rites bestow.</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.</div>
  <div class="i0">O! let not me the widow's tears renew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her age committing to the seas and wind,</div>
  <div class="i0">When every weary matron staid behind."</div>
  <div class="i0">To this, Euryalus:&mdash;"You plead in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And but protract the cause you cannot gain.</div>
  <div class="i0">No more delays! but haste!" With that, he wakes</div>
  <div class="i0">The nodding watch; each to his office takes.</div>
  <div class="i0">The guard relieved, the generous couple went</div>
  <div class="i0">To find the council at the royal tent.</div>
  <div class="i0">All creatures else forgot their daily care,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;</div>
  <div class="i0">Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate</div>
  <div class="i0">In nightly council for the endangered state.</div>
  <div class="i0">They vote a message to their absent chief,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Remote from clamour, and secure from foes.</div>
  <div class="i0">On their left arms their ample shields they bear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their right reclined upon the bending spear.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And beg admission, eager to be heard&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The affair important, not to be deferred.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ascanius bids them be conducted in,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ordering the more experienced to begin.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Nisus thus:&mdash;"Ye fathers, lend your ears;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.</div>
  <div class="i0">The foe, securely drenched in sleep and wine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Covering the plain, and curling to the skies,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Which will our way to great Æneas guide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Expect each hour to see him safe again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor can we be mistaken in the way;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, hunting in the vales, we both have seen</div>
  <div class="i0">The rising turrets, and the stream between,</div>
  <div class="i0">And know the winding course, with every ford."</div>
  <div class="i0">He ceased; and old Aletes took the word:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,</div>
  <div class="i0">While we behold such dauntless worth appear</div>
  <div class="i0">In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then into tears of joy the father broke;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Each in his longing arms by turns he took;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Panted and paused; and thus again he spoke:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,</div>
  <div class="i0">In recompense of such desert, decree?</div>
  <div class="i0">The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,</div>
  <div class="i0">The gods and your own conscious worth will give.</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest our grateful general will bestow,</div>
  <div class="i0">And young Ascanius, till his manhood, owe."</div>
  <div class="i0">"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"</div>
  <div class="i0">Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,</div>

  <div class="i0">Make me but happy in his safe return,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your common gift shall two large goblets be</div>

  <div class="i0">And, more, two tripods cast in antique mould,</div>
  <div class="i0">With two great talents of the finest gold;</div>
  <div class="i0">Beside a costly bowl, engraved with art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if in conquered Italy we reign,</div>
  <div class="i0">When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus pressed,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Twelve labouring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All clad in rich attire, and trained with care;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And a large portion of the king's domains.</div>
  <div class="i0">But thou, whose years are more to mine allied,</div>
  <div class="i0">No fate my vowed affection shall divide</div>
  <div class="i0">From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;</div>
  <div class="i0">Take full possession; all my soul is thine.</div>
  <div class="i0">One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend:</div>
  <div class="i0">My life's companion, and my bosom friend&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">My peace shall be committed to thy care;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, to thy conduct, my concerns in war."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then thus the young Euryalus replied:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,</div>
  <div class="i0">The same shall be my age, as now my youth;</div>
  <div class="i0">No time shall find me wanting to my truth.</div>

  <div class="i0">This only from your goodness let me gain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Priam's royal race my mother came&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And sure the best that ever bore the name&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold</div>
  <div class="i0">From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,</div>
  <div class="i0">My fate she followed. Ignorant of this</div>
  <div class="i0">(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in this only act of all my life deceive.</div>
  <div class="i0">By this right hand, and conscious night, I swear,</div>
  <div class="i0">My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place;</div>
  <div class="i0">(Permit me to presume so great a grace;)</div>
  <div class="i0">Support her age, forsaken and distressed.</div>
  <div class="i0">That hope alone will fortify my breast</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said. The moved assistants melt in tears.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus Ascanius, wonder-struck to see</div>
  <div class="i0">That image of his filial piety:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"So great beginnings, in so green an age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exact the faith which I again engage.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">Creüsa had, and only want the name.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis merit to have borne a son so brave.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,</div>
  <div class="i0">(My father used it,) what, returning here</div>
  <div class="i0">Crowned with success, I for thyself prepare,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, if thou fail, shall thy loved mother share."</div>
  <div class="i1">He said, and, weeping while he spoke the word,</div>
  <div class="i0">From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in an ivory scabbard sheathed the blade.</div>
  <div class="i0">This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend</div>
  <div class="i0">A lion's hide, his body to defend;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And good Aletes furnished him, beside,</div>
  <div class="i0">With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus armed they went. The noble Trojans wait</div>
  <div class="i0">Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate</div>
  <div class="i0">With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears</div>
  <div class="i0">Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,</div>
  <div class="i0">And messages committed to their care,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.</div>
  <div class="i1">The trenches first they passed; then took their way</div>
  <div class="i0">Where their proud foes in pitched pavilions lay;</div>
  <div class="i0">To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">They found the careless host dispersed upon the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, gorged, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Unharnessed chariots stand along the shore:</div>
  <div class="i0">Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,</div>
  <div class="i0">A medley of debauch and war, they lie.</div>
  <div class="i0">Observing Nisus shewed his friend the sight:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Behold a conquest gained without a fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Occasion offers, and I stand prepared;</div>
  <div class="i0">There lies our way: be thou upon the guard,</div>
  <div class="i0">And look around, while I securely go,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hew a passage through the sleeping foe."</div>
  <div class="i0">Softly he spoke; then, striding, took his way,</div>
  <div class="i0">With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;</div>
  <div class="i0">His head raised high on tapestry beneath,</div>
  <div class="i0">And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A king and prophet, by king Turnus loved;</div>
  <div class="i0">But fate by prescience cannot be removed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies</div>
  <div class="i0">Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">His armour-bearer first, and next he kills</div>
  <div class="i0">His charioteer, intrenched betwixt the wheels</div>
  <div class="i0">And his loved horses; last invades their lord;</div>
  <div class="i0">Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:</div>
  <div class="i0">The gasping head flies off; a purple flood</div>
  <div class="i0">Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Which, by the spurning heels dispersed around,</div>
  <div class="i0">The bed besprinkles, and bedews the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,</div>
  <div class="i0">He slew, and then Sarranus fair and young.</div>
  <div class="i0">From dice and wine the youth retired to rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">And puffed the fumy god from out his breast:</div>
  <div class="i0">Even then he dreamt of drink and lucky play&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">More lucky, had it lasted till the day.</div>
  <div class="i1">The famished lion thus, with hunger bold,</div>
  <div class="i0">O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe</div>
  <div class="i0">Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor with less rage Euryalus employs</div>
  <div class="i0">The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys:</div>
  <div class="i0">But on the ignoble crowd his fury flew;</div>
  <div class="i0">He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rh&oelig;tus slew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Oppressed with heavy sleep the former fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">But Rh&oelig;tus wakeful, and observing all:</div>
  <div class="i0">Behind a spacious jar he slinked for fear;</div>
  <div class="i0">The fatal iron found and reached him there;</div>
  <div class="i0">For, as he rose, it pierced his naked side,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, reeking, thence returned in crimson dyed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;</div>
  <div class="i0">The purple soul comes floating in the flood.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, where Messapus quartered, they arrive.</div>
  <div class="i0">The fires were fainting there, and just alive:</div>
  <div class="i0">The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nisus observed the discipline, and said:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;</div>
  <div class="i0">And see the scattered streaks of dawning day,</div>
  <div class="i0">Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;</div>
  <div class="i0">Here let our glutted execution end.</div>
  <div class="i0">A lane through slaughtered bodies we have made."</div>
  <div class="i0">The bold Euryalus, though loth, obeyed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find</div>
  <div class="i0">A precious load; but these they leave behind.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The queen a legion to king Turnus sent;</div>

  <div class="i0">"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? and whither bent?</div>
  <div class="i0">From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"</div>
  <div class="i0">Silent they scud away, and haste their flight</div>

  <div class="i0">The speedy horse all passages belay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way;</div>

  <div class="i0">The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fear, misled the younger from his way.</div>
  <div class="i0">But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest passed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Alban plains (from Alba's name so called)</div>
  <div class="i0">Where king Latinus then his oxen stalled;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">And missed his friend, and cast his eyes around:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Ah wretch!" he cried&mdash;"where have I left behind</div>
  <div class="i0">The unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,</div>
  <div class="i0">And treads the mazes of his former track.</div>
  <div class="i0">He winds the wood, and, listening, hears the noise</div>
  <div class="i0">Of trampling coursers, and the riders' voice.</div>
  <div class="i0">The sound approached; and suddenly he viewed</div>
  <div class="i0">The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.</div>
  <div class="i0">What should he next attempt? what arms employ,</div>
  <div class="i0">What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?</div>
  <div class="i0">Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,</div>
  <div class="i0">With odds oppressed, in such unequal strife?</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolved at length, his pointed spear he shook;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, casting on the moon a mournful look,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night!</div>
  <div class="i0">Fair queen!" he said, "direct my dart aright.</div>
  <div class="i0">If e'er my pious father, for my sake,</div>

  <div class="i0">He poised, and aimed, and launched the trembling spear.</div>
  <div class="i0">The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,</div>
  <div class="i0">Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;</div>
  <div class="i0">Pierced his thin armour, drank his vital blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in his body left the broken wood.</div>

  <div class="i0">He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,</div>

  <div class="i0">All stand amazed:&mdash;a second javelin flies</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal strength, and quivers through the skies.</div>
  <div class="i0">This through thy temples, Tagus, forced the way,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the brain-pan warmly buried lay.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor knew to fix revenge:&mdash;"But thou," he cries,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Shalt pay for both," and at the prisoner flies</div>
  <div class="i0">With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,</div>
  <div class="i0">That cruel sight the lover could not bear;</div>
  <div class="i0">But from his covert rushed in open view,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sent his voice before him as he flew:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Me! me!" he cried&mdash;"turn all your swords alone</div>
  <div class="i0">On me&mdash;the fact confessed, the fault my own.</div>
  <div class="i0">He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!</div>
  <div class="i0">His only crime (if friendship can offend)</div>
  <div class="i0">Is too much love to his unhappy friend."</div>
  <div class="i0">Too late he speaks:&mdash;the sword, which fury guides,</div>
  <div class="i0">Driven with full force, had pierced his tender sides.</div>
  <div class="i0">Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound</div>
  <div class="i0">Gushed out a purple stream, and stained the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a fair flower by the keen share oppressed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose heavy head is overcharged with rain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vowed,</div>

  <div class="i0">Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:</div>
  <div class="i0">Borne back and bored by his surrounding friends,</div>
  <div class="i0">Onward he pressed, and kept him still in sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then whirled aloft his sword with all his might:</div>
  <div class="i0">The unerring steel descended while he spoke,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pierced his wide mouth, and through his weazon broke.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Dying, he slew; and, staggering on the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,</div>
  <div class="i0">Content, in death, to be revenged so well.</div>
  <div class="i1">O happy friends! for, if my verse can give</div>
  <div class="i0">Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,</div>

  <div class="i0">Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,</div>

  <div class="i0">When early Turnus, wakening with the light,</div>
  <div class="i0">All clad in armour, calls his troops to fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">His martial men with fierce harangues he fired,</div>
  <div class="i0">And his own ardour in their souls inspired.</div>
  <div class="i0">This done&mdash;to give new terror to his foes,</div>
  <div class="i0">The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,</div>
  <div class="i0">Raised high on pointed spears&mdash;a ghastly sight!</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls:</div>
  <div class="i0">They line their trenches, and they man their walls.</div>
  <div class="i0">In front extended to the left they stood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, casting from their towers a frightful view,</div>
  <div class="i0">They saw the faces, which too well they knew,</div>

  <div class="i1">There stood a tower, amazing to the sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:</div>
  <div class="i0">Art, and the nature of the place, conspired</div>
  <div class="i0">To furnish all the strength that war required.</div>
  <div class="i0">To level this, the bold Italians join;</div>
  <div class="i0">The wary Trojans obviate their design;</div>
  <div class="i0">With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shoot through the loopholes, and sharp javelins throw.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus, the chief, tossed from his thundering hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:</div>
  <div class="i0">It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;</div>
  <div class="i0">The planks were seasoned, and the timber dry.</div>
  <div class="i0">Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,</div>
  <div class="i0">Scorched, and to distance drove, the scattered throng.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still gathering fast upon the trembling train;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,</div>
  <div class="i0">Down the defence and the defenders fall.</div>
  <div class="i0">The mighty flaw makes heaven itself resound:</div>
  <div class="i0">The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">The tower, that followed on the fallen crew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whelmed o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:</div>

  <div class="i0">Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.</div>
  <div class="i0">So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain lamented by the bleating dam.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then rushing onward with a barbarous cry,</div>
  <div class="i0">The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">The ditch with faggots filled, the daring foe</div>
  <div class="i0">Tossed firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.</div>
  <div class="i1">Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came</div>

  <div class="i0">Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,</div>

  <div class="i0">Turned to the right, his sword the hero drew,</div>

  <div class="i0">He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,</div>
  <div class="i0">The helm flies off, and bears the head along.</div>
  <div class="i0">Next him, the huntsman Amycus he killed,</div>
  <div class="i0">In darts envenomed and in poison skilled.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Cretheus, whom the Muses held so dear:</div>
  <div class="i0">He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Arms were his business, verses his delight.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their slaughtered friends, and hasten their relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom brave Serestus and his troop sustain.</div>
  <div class="i0">To save the living, and revenge the dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.</div>
  <div class="i0">"O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?</div>

  <div class="i0">Forsaking honour, and renouncing fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your gods, your country, and your king, you shame!"</div>
  <div class="i1">This just reproach their virtue does excite:</div>
  <div class="i0">They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">But with slow paces measures back the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">And inches to the walls, where Tyber's tide,</div>
  <div class="i0">Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.</div>
  <div class="i0">The more he loses, they advance the more,</div>
  <div class="i0">And tread in every step he trod before.</div>
  <div class="i0">They shout; they bear him back; and, whom by might</div>
  <div class="i0">They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.</div>
  <div class="i1">As, compassed with a wood of spears around,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lordly lion still maintains his ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;</div>
  <div class="i0">Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;</div>
  <div class="i0">He loses while in vain he presses on,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor will his courage let him dare to run:</div>
  <div class="i0">So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet twice, enraged, the combat he renews,</div>
  <div class="i0">Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.</div>
  <div class="i0">But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,</div>
  <div class="i0">Come rolling on, and rush from every side:</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor Juno, who sustained his arms before,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dares with new strength suffice the exhausted store;</div>
  <div class="i0">For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,</div>
  <div class="i0">To force the invader from the frighted town.</div>
  <div class="i1">With labour spent, no longer can he wield</div>
  <div class="i0">The heavy faulchion, or sustain the shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">O'erwhelmed with darts, which from afar they fling:</div>
  <div class="i0">The weapons round his hollow temples ring:</div>
  <div class="i0">His golden helm gives way, with stony blows</div>
  <div class="i0">Battered, and flat, and beaten to his brows.</div>

  <div class="i1">The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at every pore;</div>
  <div class="i0">With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;</div>
  <div class="i0">Shorter and shorter every gasp he takes;</div>
  <div class="i0">And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.</div>
  <div class="i0">Armed as he was, at length he leaped from high,</div>
  <div class="i0">Plunged in the flood, and made the waters fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">The yellow god the welcome burden bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wiped the sweat, and washed away the gore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.</div>

  <div class="i0"><em>And almost joined, the horns of the tough yew.</em>&mdash;P. 54.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first of these lines is all of monosyllables, and both verses
are very rough, but of choice; for it had been easy for me to
have smoothed them. But either my ear deceives me, or they express
the thing which I intended in their sound: for the stress of
a bow, which is drawn to the full extent, is expressed in the harshness
of the first verse, clogged not only with monosyllables, but
with consonants; and these words, <em>the tough yew</em>, which conclude
the second line, seem as forceful, as they are unharmonious.
Homer and Virgil are both frequent in their adapting sounds to
the thing they signify. One example will serve for both; because
Virgil borrowed the following verses from Homer's Odysses.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When I read this Æneïd to many of my friends in company together, most
of them quarrelled at the word <em>falsified</em>, as an innovation in
our language. The fact is confessed; for I remember not to have read it
in any English author, though perhaps it may be found in Spenser's "Fairy
Queen;" but, suppose it be not there, why am I forbidden to borrow from
the Italian (a polished language) the word which is wanting in my native
tongue? Terence has often Grecised; Lucretius has followed his example,
and pleaded for it&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sic quia me cogit patrii sermonis egestus.</i></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Virgil has confirmed it by his frequent practice; and even Cicero in
prose, wanting terms of philosophy in the Latin tongue, has taken them
from Aristotle's Greek. Horace has given us a rule for coining words,
<i xml:lang="gl" lang="gl">si Græco fonte cadant</i>; especially, when other words are joined with
them, which explain the sense. I use the word <em>falsify</em> in this place,
to mean, that the shield of Turnus was not of proof against the spears
and javelins of the Trojans, which had pierced it through and through (as
we say) in many places. The words which accompany this new one, make my
meaning plain, according to the precept which Horace gave. But I said I
borrowed the word from the Italian. <cite>Vide</cite> Ariosto, Cant. 26.</p>

a new word, may take the old; the matter is not worth dispute.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in
either party. At Æneas's return there is a bloody battle: Turnus
killing Pallas; Æneas, Lausus and Mezentius. Mezentius
is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth.
The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a

  <div class="i0">A lawful time of war at length will come,</div>

  <div class="i0">For partial favour, and permitted hate.</div>

  <div class="i0">Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare</div>

  <div class="i0">In shining arms triumphant on the plain?</div>
  <div class="i0">Even in their lines and trenches they contend,</div>
  <div class="i0">And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:</div>
  <div class="i0">The town is filled with slaughter, and o'erfloats,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a red deluge, their increasing moats.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, ignorant, and far from thence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Has left a camp exposed, without defence.</div>

  <div class="i0">The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,</div>
  <div class="i0">The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then thus he prayed, and fixed on heaven his eyes:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities,</div>

  <div class="i0">Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;</div>
  <div class="i0">And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."</div>
  <div class="i1">He said no more. And now renewing day</div>
  <div class="i0">Had chased the shadows of the night away.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He charged the soldiers, with preventing care,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Warned of the ensuing fight, and bade them hope the war.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, from his lofty poop, he viewed below</div>
  <div class="i0">His camp encompassed, and the inclosing foe.</div>
  <div class="i0">His blazing shield, embraced, he held on high;</div>
  <div class="i0">The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Hope arms their courage: from their towers they throw</div>
  <div class="i0">Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, at the signal given, the cranes arise</div>
  <div class="i0">Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.</div>
  <div class="i1">King Turnus wondered at the fight renewed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he viewed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The seas with swelling canvas covered o'er,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the swift ships descending on the shore.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">The radiant crest that seemed in flames to rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And dart diffusive fires around the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the keen glittering of the golden shield.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus threatening comets, when by night they rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:</div>
  <div class="i0">So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pale human kind with plagues and with dry famine frights.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet Turnus, with undaunted mind, is bent</div>
  <div class="i0">To man the shores, and hinder their descent,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus awakes the courage of his friends:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"What you so long have wished, kind Fortune sends&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">In ardent arms to meet the invading foe:</div>
  <div class="i0">You find, and find him at advantage now.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yours is the day: you need but only dare;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your swords will make you masters of the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,</div>
  <div class="i0">And dearest wives, are all within your hands.</div>
  <div class="i0">Be mindful of the race from whence you came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now take the time, while staggering yet they stand</div>
  <div class="i0">With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Fortune befriends the bold." No more he said,</div>
  <div class="i0">But balanced, whom to leave, and whom to lead;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then these elects, the landing to prevent;</div>
  <div class="i0">And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:</div>
  <div class="i0">Some are by boats exposed, by bridges more.</div>
  <div class="i0">With labouring oars they bear along the strand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the tide languishes, and leap a-land.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,</div>
  <div class="i0">But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">That course he steered, and thus he gave command:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:</div>
  <div class="i0">Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound</div>
  <div class="i0">This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let me securely land&mdash;I ask no more;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."</div>
  <div class="i1">This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:</div>
  <div class="i0">They tug at every oar, and every stretcher bends:</div>
  <div class="i0">They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,</div>
  <div class="i0">(Thus forced ashore,) and tremble with the shock.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tarchon's alone was lost, and stranded stood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">She breaks her back; the loosened sides give way,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their broken oars and floating planks withstand</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their passage, while they labour to the land,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And ebbing tides bear back upon the uncertain sand.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Advancing to the margin of the sea.</div>
  <div class="i0">The trumpets sound: Æneas first assailed</div>
  <div class="i0">The clowns new-raised and raw, and soon prevailed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.</div>
  <div class="i0">He first in open fields defied the prince:</div>
  <div class="i0">But armour scaled with gold was no defence</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the fated sword, which opened wide</div>
  <div class="i0">His plated shield, and pierced his naked side.</div>
  <div class="i1">Next Lichas fell, who, not like others born,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was from his wretched mother ripped and torn;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Sacred, O Ph&oelig;bus! from his birth to thee;</div>
  <div class="i0">For his beginning life from biting steel was free.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not far from him was Gyas laid along,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assailed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor valour nor Herculean arms availed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor their famed father, wont in war to go</div>
  <div class="i0">With great Alcides, while he toiled below.</div>
  <div class="i0">The noisy Pharos next received his death:</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas writhed his dart, and stopped his bawling breath.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then wretched Cydon had received his doom,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sought with lust obscene polluted joys&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan sword had cured his love of boys,</div>
  <div class="i0">Had not his seven bold brethren stopped the course</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the fierce champion, with united force.</div>
  <div class="i0">Seven darts were thrown at once; and some rebound</div>
  <div class="i0">From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest had reached him; but his mother's care</div>
  <div class="i0">Prevented those, and turned aside in air.</div>
  <div class="i1">The prince then called Achates, to supply</div>
  <div class="i0">The spears, that knew the way to victory&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Those fatal weapons, which, inured to blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">Against our foes, on this contended plain."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said; then seized a mighty spear, and threw;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, winged with fate, through Mæon's buckler flew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pierced all the brazen plates, and reached his heart:</div>
  <div class="i0">He staggered with intolerable smart.</div>
  <div class="i0">Alcanor saw; and reached, but reached in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">His helping hand, his brother to sustain.</div>
  <div class="i0">A second spear, which kept the former course,</div>
  <div class="i0">From the same hand, and sent with equal force,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His right arm pierced, and holding on, bereft</div>
  <div class="i0">His use of both, and pinioned down his left.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Numitor from his dead brother drew</div>
  <div class="i0">The ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:</div>
  <div class="i0">Preventing fate directs the lance awry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, glancing, only marked Achates' thigh.</div>
  <div class="i1">In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.</div>
  <div class="i0">The spear flew hissing through the middle space,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pierced his throat, directed at his face;</div>
  <div class="i0">It stopped at once the passage of his wind,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the free soul to flitting air resigned:</div>
  <div class="i0">His forehead was the first that struck the ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Life-blood and life rushed mingled through the wound.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He slew three brothers of the Borean race,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,</div>

  <div class="i0">Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:</div>
  <div class="i0">The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.</div>
  <div class="i0">With mutual blood the Ausonian soil is dyed,</div>
  <div class="i0">While on its borders each their claim decide.</div>
  <div class="i1">As wintery winds, contending in the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal force of lungs their titles try:</div>
  <div class="i0">They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heaven</div>
  <div class="i0">Stands without motion, and the tide undriven:</div>
  <div class="i0">Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">They long suspend the fortune of the field.</div>
  <div class="i0">Both armies thus perform what courage can;</div>
  <div class="i0">Foot set to foot, and mingled, man to man.</div>
  <div class="i1">But, in another part, the Arcadian horse</div>
  <div class="i0">With ill success engage the Latin force:</div>

  <div class="i0">They left their coursers, and, unused to fight</div>

  <div class="i0">Pallas, who, with disdain and grief, had viewed</div>
  <div class="i0">His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,</div>
  <div class="i0">Used threatenings mixed with prayers, his last resource,</div>
  <div class="i0">With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Which way, companions? whither would you run?</div>

  <div class="i0">Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;</div>
  <div class="i0">So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,</div>
  <div class="i0">As caused an error in their parents' eyes&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides</div>
  <div class="i0">The nice distinction, and their fate divides:</div>
  <div class="i0">For Thymbrus' head was lopped; and Laris' hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dismembered, sought its owner on the strand:</div>
  <div class="i0">The trembling fingers yet the faulchion strain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And threaten still the extended stroke in vain.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now, to renew the charge, the Arcadians came:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And grief, with anger mixed, their minds inflame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, with a casual blow was Rh&oelig;teus slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who chanced, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">The flying spear was after Ilus sent;</div>
  <div class="i0">But Rh&oelig;teus happened on a death unmeant:</div>
  <div class="i0">From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:</div>
  <div class="i0">Rolled from his chariot with a mortal wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">And intercepted fate, he spurned the ground.</div>
  <div class="i1">As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,</div>
  <div class="i0">The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,</div>
  <div class="i0">And catching flames infect the neighbouring heads;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Around the forest flies the furious blast,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And all the leafy nation sinks at last,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;</div>
  <div class="i0">The pastor, pleased with his dire victory,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">So Pallas' troops their scattered strength unite,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.</div>
  <div class="i1">Halseus came, fierce with desire of blood;</div>
  <div class="i0">But first collected in his arms he stood:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres, fell.</div>
  <div class="i0">Around his head he tossed his glittering brand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from Strymonius hewed his better hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Held up to guard his throat; then hurled a stone</div>
  <div class="i0">At Thoas' ample front, and pierced the bone:</div>
  <div class="i0">It struck beneath the space of either eye;</div>
  <div class="i0">And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep skilled in future fates, Halesus' sire</div>
  <div class="i0">Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, when the father's mortal race was run,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hauled him to the war, to find, beneath</div>
  <div class="i0">The Evandrian spear, a memorable death.</div>
  <div class="i0">Pallas the encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,</div>
  <div class="i0">To Tuscan Tyber thus addressed his vows:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O sacred stream! direct my flying dart,</div>
  <div class="i0">And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart:</div>
  <div class="i0">His arms and spoils the holy oak shall bear."</div>
  <div class="i0">Pleased with the bribe, the god received his prayer:</div>
  <div class="i0">For, while his shield protects a friend distressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The dart came driving on, and pierced his breast.</div>
  <div class="i1">But Lausus, no small portion of the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Permits not panic fear to reign too far,</div>
  <div class="i0">Caused by the death of so renowned a knight;</div>
  <div class="i0">But by his own example cheers the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce Abas first he slew&mdash;Abas, the stay</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Trojan hopes, and hinderance of the day.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Phrygian troops escaped the Greeks in vain:</div>
  <div class="i0">They, and their mixed allies, now load the plain.</div>
  <div class="i1">To the rude shock of war both armies came;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.</div>
  <div class="i0">The rear so pressed the front, they could not wield</div>
  <div class="i0">Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of equal youth and beauty both appear,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Their congress in the field great Jove withstands&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Both doomed to fall, but fall by greater hands.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">With his driven chariot he divides the crowd,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Let none presume his needless aid to join;</div>
  <div class="i0">Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:</div>
  <div class="i0">To this right hand is Pallas only due;</div>
  <div class="i0">Oh! were his father here, my just revenge to view!"</div>
  <div class="i0">From the forbidden space his men retired.</div>
  <div class="i0">Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admired;</div>
  <div class="i0">Surveyed him o'er and o'er with wondering sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Struck with his haughty mien, and towering height.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to the king:&mdash;"Your empty vaunts forbear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Alive, or dead, I shall deserve a name;</div>
  <div class="i0">Jove is impartial, and to both the same."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said, and to the void advanced his pace:</div>
  <div class="i0">Pale horror sat on each Arcadian face.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Addressed himself on foot to single fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">And, as a lion&mdash;when he spies from far</div>
  <div class="i0">A bull that seems to meditate the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,</div>
  <div class="i0">To rush from high on his unequal foe.</div>
  <div class="i1">Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance</div>
  <div class="i0">Within due distance of his flying lance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prepares to charge him first&mdash;resolved to try</div>
  <div class="i0">If fortune would his want of force supply;</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus to heaven and Hercules addressed:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest!</div>
  <div class="i0">His son adjures thee by those holy rites,</div>
  <div class="i0">That hospitable board, those genial nights;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,</div>
  <div class="i0">And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">His ravished spoils." 'Twas heard, the vain request;</div>
  <div class="i0">Alcides mourned, and stifled sighs within his breast.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Jove, to sooth his sorrow, thus began:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Tis virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.</div>
  <div class="i0">So many sons of gods, in bloody fight</div>
  <div class="i0">Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:</div>
  <div class="i0">My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Even Turnus shortly shall resign his breath</div>
  <div class="i0">And stands already on the verge of death."</div>
  <div class="i0">This said, the god permits the fatal fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">But from the Latian fields averts his sight.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, having thrown, his shining faulchion drew.</div>
  <div class="i0">The steel just grazed along the shoulder-joint,</div>
  <div class="i0">And marked it slightly with the glancing point.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,</div>
  <div class="i0">And poised his pointed spear, before he threw:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, as the winged weapon whizzed along,</div>
  <div class="i0">"See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."</div>
  <div class="i0">The spear kept on the fatal course, unstayed</div>
  <div class="i0">By plates of iron, which o'er the shield were laid:</div>
  <div class="i0">Through folded brass, and tough bull-hides, it passed,</div>
  <div class="i0">His corslet pierced, and reached his heart at last.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;</div>
  <div class="i0">The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:</div>
  <div class="i0">He falls; his arms upon his body sound;</div>
  <div class="i0">And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.</div>
  <div class="i1">Turnus bestrode the corpse:&mdash;"Arcadians, hear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Said he; "my message to your master bear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Such as the sire deserved, the son I send;</div>
  <div class="i0">It costs him dear to be the Phrygian's friend.</div>
  <div class="i0">The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow</div>
  <div class="i0">Unasked, to rest his wandering ghost below."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He said, and trampled down, with all the force</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his left foot, and spurned the wretched corse;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then snatched the shining belt, with gold inlaid&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where fifty fatal brides, expressed to sight,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All in the compass of one mournful night,</div>

  <div class="i1">In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore</div>
  <div class="i0">Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.</div>
  <div class="i0">O mortals! blind in<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> fate, who never know</div>

  <div class="i0">The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall wish untouched the trophies of the slain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,</div>
  <div class="i0">And curse the dire remembrance of the day.</div>
  <div class="i1">The sad Arcadians, from the unhappy field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bear back the breathless body on a shield.</div>
  <div class="i0">O grace and grief of war! at once restored,</div>
  <div class="i0">With praises, to thy sire, at once deplored.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day first sent thee to the fighting field,</div>

  <div class="i0">This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">But sad spectators, to the hero came:</div>
  <div class="i0">His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless relieved by his victorious hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">He whirls his sword around, without delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hews through adverse foes an ample way,</div>
  <div class="i0">To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud.</div>
  <div class="i0">Evander, Pallas, all that friendship owed</div>
  <div class="i0">To large deserts, are present to his eyes&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,</div>
  <div class="i0">He took in fight, and living victims led,</div>
  <div class="i0">To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,</div>
  <div class="i0">In sacrifice, before his funeral fire.</div>
  <div class="i0">At Magus next he threw: he stooped below</div>
  <div class="i0">The flying spear, and shunned the promised blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, creeping, clasped the hero's knees, and prayed:</div>
  <div class="i0">"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,</div>
  <div class="i0">O! spare my life, and send me back to see</div>
  <div class="i0">My longing sire, and tender progeny.</div>
  <div class="i0">A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,</div>
  <div class="i0">In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:</div>
  <div class="i0">All these, and sums besides, which see no day,</div>
  <div class="i0">The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.</div>
  <div class="i0">If I survive, shall Troy the less prevail?</div>
  <div class="i0">A single soul's too light to turn the scale."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said. The hero sternly thus replied:&mdash;-</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,</div>
  <div class="i0">Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke</div>
  <div class="i0">All rules of war by one relentless stroke,</div>
  <div class="i0">When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">My father's shadow, but my living son."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,</div>
  <div class="i0">He seized his helm, and dragged him with his left;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreathed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Up to the hilts his shining faulchion sheathed.</div>
  <div class="i1">Apollo's priest, Hæmonides, was near;</div>
  <div class="i0">His holy fillets on his front appear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Glittering in arms, he shone amidst the crowd,</div>
  <div class="i0">Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him the fierce Trojan followed through the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">The holy coward fell; and, forced to yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sent him an offering to the shades below.</div>
  <div class="i0">His arms Serestus on his shoulders bears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Designed a trophy to the god of wars.</div>

  <div class="i0">At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Both shield and arm to ground together go.</div>
  <div class="i0">Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thought he wore impenetrable arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">So made by muttered spells; and, from the spheres,</div>

  <div class="i0">Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,</div>
  <div class="i0">Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;</div>
  <div class="i0">Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and (as he lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain tales inventing, and prepared to pray)</div>
  <div class="i0">Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,</div>

  <div class="i0">Far from thy mother and thy native home,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."</div>
  <div class="i1">On Lucas and Antæus next he ran,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When once his faulchion found the taste of blood.</div>
  <div class="i1">With fury scarce to be conceived, he flew</div>
  <div class="i0">Against Niphæus, whom four coursers drew.</div>
  <div class="i0">They, when they see the fiery chief advance,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wheeled with so swift a motion, mad with fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">They threw their master headlong from the chair.</div>
  <div class="i0">They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before</div>
  <div class="i0">They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains&mdash;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bold brethren both. The former waved in air</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His flaming sword: Æneas couched his spear,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unused to threats, and more unused to fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Liger thus:&mdash;"Thy confidence is vain</div>

  <div class="i0">Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor Venus' veil is here, nor Neptune's shield;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer</div>
  <div class="i0">Returned his answer with his flying spear.</div>
  <div class="i0">As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,</div>
  <div class="i0">Prepared for fight&mdash;the fatal dart arrives,</div>
  <div class="i0">And through the border of his buckler drives;</div>
  <div class="i0">Passed through, and pierced his groin. The deadly wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cast from his chariot, rolled him on the ground:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;</div>
  <div class="i0">But you yourself forsake your empty seat."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said, and seized at once the loosened rein;</div>
  <div class="i0">For Liger lay already on the plain</div>
  <div class="i0">By the same shock; then, stretching out his hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">The recreant thus his wretched life demands:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!</div>
  <div class="i0">By her and him from whom thy breath began,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who formed thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare</div>
  <div class="i0">This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's prayer."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;</div>
  <div class="i0">But the stern hero turned aside his head,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cut him short:&mdash;"I hear another man;</div>
  <div class="i0">You talked not thus before the fight began.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,</div>
  <div class="i0">Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then through his breast his fatal sword he sent,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the soul issued at the gaping vent.</div>
  <div class="i0">As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus raged the prince, and scattered deaths around.</div>
  <div class="i0">At length Ascanius, and the Trojan train,</div>

  <div class="i0">Meantime the king of gods and mortal man</div>

  <div class="i0">Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."</div>
  <div class="i0">To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Soft in her tone, submissively replies:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Why, O my sovereign lord, whose frown I fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cannot, unconcerned, your anger bear&mdash;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still,</div>
  <div class="i0">(As once I was,) were mistress of your will,</div>
  <div class="i0">From your almighty power your pleasing wife</div>
  <div class="i0">Might gain the grace of lengthening Turnus' life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And give him to his aged father's sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now let him perish, since you hold it good,</div>
  <div class="i0">And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet from our lineage he derives his name,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came!</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">And offers daily incense at your shrine."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then shortly thus the sovereign god replied:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Since in my power and goodness you confide,</div>
  <div class="i0">If, for a little space, a lengthened span,</div>
  <div class="i0">You beg reprieve for this expiring man,</div>
  <div class="i0">I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence</div>
  <div class="i0">From instant fate, and can so far dispense.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,</div>
  <div class="i0">To save the short-lived youth from destined death,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, if a farther thought you entertain,</div>
  <div class="i0">To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."</div>
  <div class="i1">To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"And what if that request, your tongue denies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your heart should grant&mdash;and not a short reprieve,</div>
  <div class="i0">But length of certain life, to Turnus give?</div>
  <div class="i0">Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,</div>
  <div class="i0">If my presaging soul divines with truth;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, O! I wish, might err through causeless fears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And you (for you have power) prolong his years!"</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus having said, involved in clouds, she flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And drives a storm before her through the skies.</div>
  <div class="i0">Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of air condensed, a spectre soon she made;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, what Æneas was, such seemed the shade.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Adorned with Dardan arms, the phantom bore</div>
  <div class="i0">His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore:</div>
  <div class="i0">This hand appeared a shining sword to wield,</div>
  <div class="i0">And that sustained an imitated shield.</div>
  <div class="i0">With manly mien he stalked along the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.</div>
  <div class="i0">(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)</div>
  <div class="i0">The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare,</div>
  <div class="i0">And flourishes his empty sword in air.</div>
  <div class="i0">At this, advancing, Turnus hurled his spear:</div>
  <div class="i0">The phantom wheeled, and seemed to fly for fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Whither, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor found he spoke to wind, and chased a cloud,)</div>
  <div class="i0">"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me</div>
  <div class="i0">The fated land you sought so long by sea."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,</div>
  <div class="i0">With eager pace pursued the flying shade.</div>
  <div class="i0">By chance a ship was fastened to the shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which from old Clusium king Osinius bore:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And skipped and skulked, and under hatches went.</div>
  <div class="i0">Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ascends the plank, and to the galley passed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce had he reached the prow; Saturnia's hand</div>
  <div class="i0">The halsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.</div>
  <div class="i0">With wind in poop, the vessel ploughs the sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">And measures back with speed her former way.</div>
  <div class="i0">Meantime Æneas seeks his absent foe,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sends his slaughtered troops to shades below.</div>
  <div class="i1">The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,</div>
  <div class="i0">And flew sublime, and vanished in a cloud.</div>
  <div class="i0">Too late young Turnus the delusion found,</div>
  <div class="i0">Far on the sea, still making from the ground.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then, thankless for a life redeemed by shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fearful besides of what in fight had passed,</div>
  <div class="i0">His hands and hagard eyes to heaven he cast:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O Jove!" he cried&mdash;"for what offence have I</div>
  <div class="i0">Deserved to bear this endless infamy?</div>
  <div class="i0">Whence am I forced, and whither am I borne?</div>
  <div class="i0">How, and with what reproach, shall I return?</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or see Laurentum's lofty towers again?</div>
  <div class="i0">What will they say of their deserting chief?</div>
  <div class="i0">The war was mine: I fly from their relief!</div>
  <div class="i0">I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;</div>
  <div class="i0">And even from hence their dying groans receive.</div>
  <div class="i0">Here, over-matched in fight, in heaps they lie,</div>
  <div class="i0">There, scattered o'er the fields, ignobly fly.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or, oh! ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or set me shipwrecked on some desert shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus Turnus raved, and various fates revolved:</div>
  <div class="i0">The choice was doubtful, but the death resolved.</div>
  <div class="i0">And now the sword, and now the sea, took place&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,</div>
  <div class="i0">By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice he the sword essayed, and thrice the flood;</div>
  <div class="i0">But Juno, moved with pity, both withstood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thrice repressed his rage; strong gales supplied,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pushed the vessel o'er the swelling tide.</div>
  <div class="i0">At length she lands him on his native shores,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to his father's longing arms restores.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius armed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warmed</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His fainting friends, reproached their shameful flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Repelled the victors, and renewed the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire</div>
  <div class="i0">Of wished revenge&mdash;on him, and him alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">All hands employed, and all their darts are thrown.</div>
  <div class="i0">He, like a solid rock by seas inclosed,</div>
  <div class="i0">To raging winds and roaring waves opposed,</div>
  <div class="i0">From his proud summit looking down, disdains</div>
  <div class="i0">Their empty menace, and unmoved remains.</div>
  <div class="i1">Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.</div>
  <div class="i0">At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:</div>
  <div class="i0">His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.</div>
  <div class="i0">But Palmus from behind receives his wound:</div>
  <div class="i0">Hamstringed he falls, and grovels on the ground:</div>
  <div class="i0">His crest and armour, from his body torn,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head, adorn.</div>
  <div class="i0">Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">The queen produced young Paris to his sire.</div>
  <div class="i0">But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.</div>
  <div class="i1">And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,</div>
  <div class="i0">With forest mast and fattening marshes fed,</div>
  <div class="i0">When once he sees himself in toils inclosed,</div>
  <div class="i0">By huntsmen and their eager hounds opposed,</div>
  <div class="i0">He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">The invaders dart their javelins from afar:</div>
  <div class="i0">All keep aloof, and safely shout around;</div>
  <div class="i0">But none presumes to give a nearer wound:</div>
  <div class="i0">He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And shakes a grove of lances from his side:</div>
  <div class="i0">Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspired,</div>
  <div class="i0">And just revenge against the tyrant fired,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Their darts with clamour at a distance drive,</div>
  <div class="i0">And only keep the languished war alive.</div>
  <div class="i1">From Corythus came Acron to the fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who left his spouse betrothed, and unconsummate night.</div>
  <div class="i0">Mezentius sees him through the squadron ride,</div>
  <div class="i0">Proud of the purple favours of his bride.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds</div>
  <div class="i0">A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane;</div>
  <div class="i0">He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws:</div>
  <div class="i0">The prey lies panting underneath his paws:</div>
  <div class="i0">He fills his famished maw; his mouth runs o'er</div>
  <div class="i0">With unchewed morsels, while he churns the gore:</div>
  <div class="i0">So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And first unhappy Acron overthrows:</div>
  <div class="i0">Stretched at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">The lance, besmeared with blood, lies broken in the wound.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then with disdain the haughty victor viewed</div>
  <div class="i0">Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor thought the dastard's back deserved a wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">But, running, gained the advantage of the ground:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then turning short, he met him face to face,</div>
  <div class="i0">To give his victory the better grace.</div>
  <div class="i0">Orodes falls, in equal fight oppressed:</div>
  <div class="i0">Mezentius fixed his foot upon his breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"</div>
  <div class="i0">The fields around with "Iö Pæan!" ring;</div>
  <div class="i0">And peals of shouts applaud the conquering king.</div>
  <div class="i0">At this the vanquished, with his dying breath,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Nor thou, proud man, unpunished shalt remain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;</div>
  <div class="i0">But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.</div>
  <div class="i0">A hovering mist came swimming o'er his sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sealed his eyes in everlasting night.</div>
  <div class="i1">By Cædicus, Alcathöus was slain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;</div>
  <div class="i0">He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo killed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who threw his master, as he made a bound:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.</div>
  <div class="i1">Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,</div>
  <div class="i0">To single fight the boldest foe defied;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,</div>
  <div class="i0">And not belied his mighty father's fame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Salius to death the great Authronius sent:</div>
  <div class="i0">But the same fate the victor underwent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Slain by Nealces' hand, well skilled to throw</div>
  <div class="i0">The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance:</div>
  <div class="i0">By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Victors and vanquished in the various field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.</div>
  <div class="i0">The gods from heaven survey the fatal strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">And mourn the miseries of human life.</div>
  <div class="i0">Above the rest, two goddesses appear</div>
  <div class="i0">Concerned for each: here Venus, Juno there.</div>
  <div class="i0">Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes</div>
  <div class="i0">Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.</div>
  <div class="i1">Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Brandished his spear, and rushed into the plain,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Where towering in the midmost ranks he stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,</div>
  <div class="i0">His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Or like a mountain-ash, whose roots are spread,</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep fixed in earth&mdash;in clouds he hides his head.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,</div>
  <div class="i0">And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Collected in his strength, and like a rock</div>
  <div class="i0">Poised on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.</div>
  <div class="i0">He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!</div>
  <div class="i0">(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke)</div>
  <div class="i0">His armour, from the Trojan pirate torn,</div>
  <div class="i0">By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."</div>
  <div class="i0">He said; and with his utmost force he threw</div>
  <div class="i0">The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Reached the celestial shield: that stopped the course;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force</div>
  <div class="i0">Took a new bent obliquely, and, betwixt</div>
  <div class="i0">The side and bowels, famed Antores fixed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Antores had from Argos travelled far,</div>
  <div class="i0">Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, tired with toils, fair Italy he chose,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in Evander's palace sought repose.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now falling by another's wound, his eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks, and dies.</div>
  <div class="i1">The pious Trojan then his javelin sent;</div>
  <div class="i0">The shield gave way; through triple plates it went</div>
  <div class="i0">Of solid brass, of linen triply rolled,</div>
  <div class="i0">And three bull-hides which round the buckler rolled.</div>
  <div class="i0">All these it passed, resistless in the course,</div>
  <div class="i0">Transpierced his thigh, and spent its dying force.</div>
  <div class="i0">The gaping wound gushed out a crimson flood.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His faulchion drew, to closer fight addressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with new force his fainting foe oppressed.</div>
  <div class="i1">His father's peril Lausus viewed with grief;</div>
  <div class="i0">He sighed, he wept, he ran to his relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">And here, heroic youth, 'tis here I must</div>
  <div class="i0">To thy immortal memory be just,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sing an act so noble and so new,</div>
  <div class="i0">Posterity will scarce believe 'tis true.</div>
  <div class="i0">Pained with his wound, and useless for the fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">The father sought to save himself by flight:</div>
  <div class="i0">Encumbered, slow he dragged the spear along,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which pierced his thigh, and in his buckler hung.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The pious youth, resolved on death, below</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The lifted sword, springs forth to face the foe;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.</div>
  <div class="i0">Shouts of applause ran ringing through the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">To see the son the vanquished father shield.</div>
  <div class="i0">All, fired with generous indignation, strive,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a storm of darts, to distance drive</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,</div>
  <div class="i0">On his Vulcanian orb sustained the war.</div>
  <div class="i1">As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,</div>
  <div class="i0">The ploughman, passenger, and labouring hind,</div>
  <div class="i0">For shelter to the neighbouring covert fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, housed, or safe in hollow caverns, lie;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, that o'erblown, when heaven above them smiles,</div>
  <div class="i0">Return to travail, and renew their toils:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Æneas thus, o'erwhelmed on every side,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threatening cried:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage</div>
  <div class="i0">In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Betrayed by pious love?"&mdash;Nor, thus forborne,</div>
  <div class="i0">The youth desists, but with insulting scorn</div>
  <div class="i0">Provokes the lingering prince, whose patience, tired,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gave place; and all his breast with fury fired.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For now the Fates prepared their sharpened shears;</div>
  <div class="i0">And lifted high the flaming sword appears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, full descending with a frightful sway,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through shield and corslet forced the impetuous way,</div>
  <div class="i0">And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.</div>
  <div class="i0">The purple streams through the thin armour strove,</div>
  <div class="i0">And drenched the embroidered coat his mother wove;</div>
  <div class="i0">And life at length forsook his heaving heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.</div>
  <div class="i1">But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,</div>
  <div class="i0">The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,</div>
  <div class="i0">He grieved; he wept, (the sight an image brought</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Then stretched his hand to hold him up, and said:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid</div>
  <div class="i0">To love so great, to such transcendent store</div>
  <div class="i0">Of early worth, and sure presage of more?</div>
  <div class="i0">Accept whate'er Æneas can afford;</div>
  <div class="i0">Untouched thy arms, untaken be thy sword;</div>
  <div class="i0">And all that pleased the living, still remain</div>
  <div class="i0">Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thy body on thy parents I bestow,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or have a sense of human things below.</div>
  <div class="i0">There to thy fellow-ghosts with glory tell,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas by the great Æneas' hand I fell."</div>
  <div class="i0">With this, his distant friends he beckons near,</div>
  <div class="i0">Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Himself assists to lift him from the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">With clotted locks, and blood that welled from out the wound.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And washed his wounds, by Tyber's yellow flood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Oppressed with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,</div>
  <div class="i0">His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;</div>
  <div class="i0">His heavier arms lay scattered on the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">A chosen train of youth around him stand;</div>
  <div class="i0">His drooping head was rested on his hand:</div>

  <div class="i0">To warn him from the field&mdash;alas! in vain!</div>
  <div class="i0">Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er his broad shield still gushed the yawning wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">And drew a bloody trail along the ground.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;</div>

  <div class="i0">This is a wound too deep for time to heal.</div>
  <div class="i0">My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;</div>
  <div class="i0">My blackness blotted thy unblemished name.</div>

  <div class="i0">He said; and straight the officious courser kneels,</div>

  <div class="i0">With pointed javelins; on his head he laced</div>
  <div class="i0">His glittering helm, which terribly was graced</div>
  <div class="i0">With waving horse-hair, nodding from afar;</div>

  <div class="i0">He spoke no more, but hastened, void of fear,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,</div>

  <div class="i0">The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Impatient of delay, and weary grown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still to defend, and to defend alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Urged, and o'er-laboured in unequal fight&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">At length resolved, he throws, with all his force,</div>
  <div class="i0">Full at the temples of the warrior horse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Just where the stroke was aimed, the unerring spear</div>
  <div class="i0">Made way, and stood transfixed through either ear.</div>

  <div class="i0">His lord's encumbered shoulder overlaid.</div>
  <div class="i1">From either host, the mingled shouts and cries</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies:</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, hastening, waved his fatal sword</div>
  <div class="i0">High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">"Now! where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"</div>
  <div class="i1">Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies</div>

  <div class="i0">"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,</div>

<p>These were transformed from ships to sea-nymphs. This is almost
as violent a machine, as the death of Arruns by a goddess in
the episode of Camilla. But the poet makes use of it with greater
art; for here it carries on the main design. These new-made divinities
not only tell Æneas what had passed in his camp during
his absence, and what was the present distress of his besieged people,
and that his horsemen, whom he had sent by land, were
ready to join him at his descent; but warn him to provide for
battle the next day, and foretel him good success: so that this
episodical machine is properly a part of the great poem; for, besides
what I have said, they push on his navy with celestial vigour,
that it might reach the port more speedily, and take the enemy
more unprovided to resist the landing: whereas the machine relating
to Camilla is only ornamental; for it has no effect, which I
can find, but to please the reader, who is concerned that her
death should be revenged.</p>

<p>The poet here begins to tell the names of the Tuscan captains
who followed Æneas to the war: and I observe him to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
particular in the description of their persons, and not forgetful of
their manners; exact also in the relation of the numbers which
each of them command. I doubt not but, as, in the Fifth Book,
he gave us the names of the champions who contended for the several
prizes, that he might oblige many of the most ancient Roman
families, their descendants&mdash;and as, in the Seventh Book, he
mustered the auxiliary forces of the Latins on the same account&mdash;so
here he gratifies his Tuscan friends with the like remembrance
of their ancestors, and, above the rest, Mæcenas, his great patron,
who, being of a royal family in Etruria, was probably represented
under one of the names here mentioned, then known
among the Romans, though, at so great a distance, unknown to
us. And, for his sake chiefly, as I guess, he makes Æneas (by
whom he always means Augustus) to seek for aid in the country
of Mæcenas, thereby to endear his protector to his emperor, as if
there had been a former friendship betwixt their lines. And who
knows, but Mæcenas might pretend, that the Cilnian family was
derived from Tarchon, the chief commander of the Tuscans?</p>

<p>I have mentioned this passage in my preface to the Æneïs, to
prove that fate was superior to the gods, and that Jove could
neither defer nor alter its decrees. Sir Robert Howard has since
been pleased to send me the concurrent testimony of Ovid: it is
in the last book of his Metamorphoses, where Venus complains
that her descendant, Julius Cæsar, was in danger of being murdered
by Brutus and Cassius, at the head of the commonwealth-faction,
and desires [<i>the gods</i>] to prevent that barbarous assassination.
They are moved to compassion; they are concerned for
Cæsar; but the poet plainly tells us, that it was not in their power
to change destiny. All they could do, was to testify their sorrow
for his approaching death, by fore-shewing it with signs and prodigies,
as appears by the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she addresses to her father Jupiter, hoping aid from him,
because he was thought omnipotent. But he, it seems, could do
as little as the rest; for he answers thus:</p>

<p>Jupiter, you see, is only library-keeper, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">custos rotulorum</i>,
to the Fates: for he offers his daughter a cast of his office, to give
her a sight of their decrees, which the inferior gods were not permitted
to read without his leave. This agrees with what I have
said already in the preface; that they, not having seen the records,
might believe they were his own hand-writing, and consequently
at his disposing, either to blot out or alter as he saw
convenient. And of this opinion was Juno in those words, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tua,
qui potes, orsa reflectas</i>. Now the abode of those Destinies being
in hell, we cannot wonder why the swearing by Styx was an inviolable
oath amongst the gods of heaven, and that Jupiter himself
should fear to be accused of forgery by the Fates, if he altered
any thing in their decrees; Chaos, Night, and Erebus, being the
most ancient of the deities, and instituting those fundamental laws,
by which he was afterwards to govern. Hesiod gives us the genealogy
of the gods; and I think I may safely infer the rest. I
will only add, that Homer was more a fatalist than Virgil: for it
has been observed, that the word Τυχη, or <em>Fortune</em>, is not to be
found in his two poems; but, instead of it, always Μοιρα.</p>

  <div class="i0">And chose a thousand horse, the flower of all</div>
  <div class="i0">His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,</div>
  <div class="i0">To bear him back, and share Evander's grief&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A well-becoming, but a weak relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.</div>
  <div class="i0">The body on this rural hearse is borne:</div>
  <div class="i0">Strewed leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.</div>
  <div class="i0">All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flower,</div>
  <div class="i0">New cropt by virgin hands, to dress the bower:</div>
  <div class="i0">Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,</div>
  <div class="i0">No more to mother earth or the green stem shall owe.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then two fair vests, of wonderous work and cost,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of purple woven, and with gold embossed,</div>
  <div class="i0">For ornament the Trojan hero brought,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.</div>
  <div class="i0">One vest arrayed the corpse; and one they spread</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er his closed eyes, and wrapped around his head,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">The catching fire might burn the golden caul.</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">When he descended on the Latian plain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Arms, trappings, horses&mdash;by the hearse are led</div>
  <div class="i0">In long array&mdash;the achievements of the dead.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, pinioned with their hands behind, appear</div>
  <div class="i0">The unhappy captives, marching in the rear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Appointed offerings in the victor's name,</div>
  <div class="i0">To sprinkle with their blood the funeral flame.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;</div>
  <div class="i0">Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;</div>
  <div class="i0">And fair inscriptions fixed, and titles read</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Latian leaders conquered by the dead.</div>
  <div class="i1">Ac&oelig;tes on his pupil's corpse attends,</div>
  <div class="i0">With feeble steps, supported by his friends.</div>
  <div class="i0">Pausing at every pace, in sorrow drowned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where grovelling while he lies in deep despair,</div>
  <div class="i0">He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.</div>
  <div class="i0">The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,</div>
  <div class="i0">Besmeared with hostile blood, and honourably foul.</div>
  <div class="i0">To close the pomp, Æthon, the steed of state,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is led, the funerals of his lord to wait.</div>
  <div class="i0">Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace</div>
  <div class="i0">He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.</div>
  <div class="i0">The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are borne behind:&mdash;the victor seized the rest.</div>
  <div class="i0">The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;</div>
  <div class="i0">The pikes and lances trail along the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse</div>
  <div class="i0">To Pallantean towers direct their course,</div>
  <div class="i0">In long procession ranked; the pious chief</div>
  <div class="i0">Stopped in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The public care," he said, "which war attends,</div>
  <div class="i0">Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.</div>
  <div class="i0">Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!</div>
  <div class="i0">Hail, holy reliques! and a last farewell!"</div>
  <div class="i0">He said no more, but, inly though he mourned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Restrained his tears, and to the camp returned.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand</div>
  <div class="i0">A truce, with olive-branches in their hand;</div>
  <div class="i0">Obtest his clemency, and from the plain</div>
  <div class="i0">Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">They plead, that none those common rites deny</div>
  <div class="i0">To conquered foes, that in fair battle die.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">All cause of hate was ended in their death;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.</div>
  <div class="i0">A king, they hoped, would hear a king's request,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose son he once was called, and once his guest.</div>
  <div class="i1">Their suit, which was too just to be denied,</div>
  <div class="i0">The hero grants, and farther thus replied:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O Latian princes! how severe a fate</div>
  <div class="i0">In causeless quarrels has involved your state,</div>
  <div class="i0">And armed against an unoffending man,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who sought your friendship ere the war began!</div>
  <div class="i0">You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not only for the slain, but those who live.</div>
  <div class="i0">I came not hither but by heaven's command,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sent by fate to share the Latian land.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied</div>
  <div class="i0">My proffered friendship, and my promised bride;</div>
  <div class="i0">Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try</div>
  <div class="i0">His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.</div>
  <div class="i0">My right and his are in dispute: the slain</div>
  <div class="i0">Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.</div>
  <div class="i0">In equal arms let us alone contend;</div>
  <div class="i0">And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.</div>
  <div class="i0">This is the way (so tell him) to possess</div>
  <div class="i0">The royal virgin, and restore the peace.</div>
  <div class="i0">Bear this my message back&mdash;with ample leave,</div>
  <div class="i0">That your slain friends may funeral rites receive."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus having said&mdash;the embassadors, amazed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stood mute a while, and on each other gazed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Drances, their chief, who harboured in his breast</div>
  <div class="i0">Long hate to Turnus, as his foe professed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,</div>
  <div class="i0">With graceful action bowing, thus began:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,</div>
  <div class="i0">But yet whose actions far transcend your fame!</div>
  <div class="i0">Would I your justice or your force express,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thought can but equal; and all words are less.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Your answer we shall thankfully relate,</div>
  <div class="i0">And favours granted to the Latian state.</div>
  <div class="i0">If wished success our labour shall attend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:</div>
  <div class="i0">Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,</div>
  <div class="i0">And seek alliance in some other land:</div>
  <div class="i0">Build you the city which your fates assign;</div>
  <div class="i0">We shall be proud in the great work to join."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest empowered, that soon a truce is made.</div>
  <div class="i0">Twelve days the term allowed: and, during those,</div>
  <div class="i0">Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mixed in the woods, for funeral piles prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">To fell the timber, and forget the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud axes through the groaning groves resound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Oak, mountain-ash, and poplar, spread the ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Firs fall from high; and some the trunks receive</div>
  <div class="i0">In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.</div>
  <div class="i1">And now the fatal news by Fame is blown</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the short circuit of the Arcadian town,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Pallas slain&mdash;, by Fame, which just before</div>
  <div class="i0">His triumphs on distended pinions bore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each with a funeral flambeau in his hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:</div>
  <div class="i0">The fields are lightened with a fiery blaze,</div>
  <div class="i0">That casts a sullen splendour on their friends&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The marching troop which their dead prince attends.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,</div>

  <div class="i0">The town is filled with tumult and with tears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till the loud clamours reach Evander's ears:</div>
  <div class="i0">Forgetful of his state, he runs along,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a disordered pace, and cleaves the throng;</div>
  <div class="i0">Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,</div>
  <div class="i0">With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks</div>
  <div class="i0">A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"O Pallas! thou hast failed thy plighted word!</div>
  <div class="i0">To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">I warned thee, but in vain; for well I knew</div>
  <div class="i0">What perils youthful ardour would pursue&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That boiling blood would carry thee too far,</div>
  <div class="i0">Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!</div>
  <div class="i0">O curst essay of arms! disastrous doom!</div>
  <div class="i0">Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard elements of inauspicious war!</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain vows to heaven, and unavailing care!</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed!</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Præscious of ills, and leaving me behind,</div>
  <div class="i0">To drink the dregs of life by fate assigned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:</div>
  <div class="i0">My Pallas late set out, but reached too soon.</div>
  <div class="i0">If, for my league against the Ausonian state,</div>
  <div class="i0">Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">(Deserved from them,) then I had been returned</div>
  <div class="i0">A breathless victor, and my son had mourned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor grudge the alliance I so gladly made.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,</div>
  <div class="i0">But my own crime for having lived too long.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, since the gods had destined him to die,</div>
  <div class="i0">At least, he led the way to victory:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First for his friends he won the fatal shore,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And sent whole herds of slaughtered foes before&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A death too great, too glorious to deplore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor will I add new honours to thy grave,</div>
  <div class="i0">Content with those the Trojan hero gave&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends designed,</div>
  <div class="i0">In which the Tuscan chiefs and army joined.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,</div>

  <div class="i0">If Pallas had arrived, with equal length</div>
  <div class="i0">Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.</div>
  <div class="i0">But why, unhappy man! dost thou detain</div>
  <div class="i0">These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?</div>
  <div class="i0">Go, friends! this message to your lord relate:</div>
  <div class="i0">Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, after Pallas' death, live lingering on,</div>

  <div class="i0">What squalid spectres, in the dead of night,</div>
  <div class="i0">Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!</div>
  <div class="i0">I might have promised to myself those harms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Presumed against immortal powers to move,</div>
  <div class="i0">And violate with wounds the queen of love.</div>
  <div class="i0">Such arms this hand shall never more employ.</div>
  <div class="i0">No hate remains with me to ruined Troy.</div>
  <div class="i0">I war not with its dust; nor am I glad</div>
  <div class="i0">To think of past events, or good or bad.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your presents I return: whate'er you bring</div>
  <div class="i0">To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.</div>
  <div class="i0">We met in fight: I know him, to my cost:</div>
  <div class="i0">With what a whirling force his lance he tossed!</div>
  <div class="i0">Heavens! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!</div>
  <div class="i0">How high he held his shield, and rose at every blow!</div>
  <div class="i0">Had Troy produced two more his match in might,</div>
  <div class="i0">They would have changed the fortune of the fight:</div>
  <div class="i0">The invasion of the Greeks had been returned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our empire wasted, and our cities burned.</div>
  <div class="i0">The long defence the Trojan people made,</div>
  <div class="i0">The war protracted, and the siege delayed,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Both brave alike, and equal in command;</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, not inferior in the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">In pious reverence to the gods excelled.</div>
  <div class="i0">Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care</div>
  <div class="i0">The impending dangers of a fatal war.'</div>
  <div class="i0">He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Refused the alliance, and advised a truce."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus Venulus concluded his report.</div>
  <div class="i0">A jarring murmur filled the factious court:</div>
  <div class="i0">As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,</div>
  <div class="i0">And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course,</div>
  <div class="i0">The flood, constrained within a scanty space,</div>
  <div class="i0">Roars horrible along the uneasy race;</div>
  <div class="i0">White foam in gathering eddies floats around;</div>
  <div class="i0">The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.</div>
  <div class="i1">The murmur ceased: then from his lofty throne</div>
  <div class="i0">The king invoked the gods, and thus begun:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"I wish, ye Latians, what we now debate</div>
  <div class="i0">Had been resolved before it was too late.</div>
  <div class="i0">Much better had it been for you and me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unforced by this our last necessity,</div>
  <div class="i0">To have been earlier wise, than now to call</div>
  <div class="i0">A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.</div>
  <div class="i0">O citizens! we wage unequal war,</div>
  <div class="i0">With men, not only heaven's peculiar care,</div>
  <div class="i0">But heaven's own race&mdash;unconquered in the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, conquered, yet unknowing how to yield.</div>
  <div class="i0">What hopes you had in Diomede, lay down:</div>
  <div class="i0">Our hopes must centre in ourselves alone.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">You see too well; nor need my words explain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Vanquished without resource&mdash;laid flat by fate&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Factions within, a foe without the gate!</div>
  <div class="i0">Not but I grant that all performed their parts</div>
  <div class="i0">With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">With our united strength the war we waged;</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal numbers, equal arms, engaged:</div>
  <div class="i0">You see the event.&mdash;Now hear what I propose,</div>
  <div class="i0">To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.</div>
  <div class="i0">A tract of land the Latians have possessed</div>
  <div class="i0">Along the Tyber, stretching to the west,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,</div>
  <div class="i0">And their mixed cattle graze the fruitful hill.</div>
  <div class="i0">Those mountains filled with firs, that lower land,</div>
  <div class="i0">If you consent, the Trojans shall command,</div>
  <div class="i0">Called into part of what is ours; and there,</div>
  <div class="i0">On terms agreed, the common country share.</div>
  <div class="i0">There let them build and settle, if they please;</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless they chuse once more to cross the seas,</div>
  <div class="i0">In search of seats remote from Italy,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from unwelcome inmates set us free.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or twice as many more, if more they need.</div>
  <div class="i0">Materials are at hand: a well-grown wood</div>
  <div class="i0">Runs equal with the margin of the flood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Let them the number and the form assign;</div>
  <div class="i0">The care and cost of all the stores be mine.</div>
  <div class="i0">To treat the peace, a hundred senators</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall be commissioned hence with ample powers,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With olive crowned: the presents they shall bear,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A purple robe, a royal ivory chair,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate</div>
  <div class="i0">This great affair, and save the sinking state."</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Drances took the word, who grudged, long since,</div>
  <div class="i0">The rising glories of the Daunian prince.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Factious and rich, bold at the council-board,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But cautious in the field, he shunned the sword&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.</div>
  <div class="i0">Noble his mother was, and near the throne;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, what his father's parentage, unknown.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He rose, and took the advantage of the times,</div>
  <div class="i0">To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain,</div>
  <div class="i0">As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek</div>
  <div class="i0">What common needs require, but fear to speak.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose pride this inauspicious war began;</div>
  <div class="i0">For whose ambition, (let me dare to say,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fear set apart, though death is in my way,)</div>
  <div class="i0">The plains of Latium run with blood around;</div>
  <div class="i0">So many valiant heroes bite the ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Dejected grief in every face appears;</div>
  <div class="i0">A town in mourning, and a land in tears;</div>
  <div class="i0">While he, the undoubted author of our harms,</div>
  <div class="i0">The man who menaces the gods with arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sought his safety in ignoble flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, best of kings, since you propose to send</div>
  <div class="i0">Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;</div>
  <div class="i0">Add yet a greater at our joint request,</div>
  <div class="i0">One which he values more than all the rest:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With that alliance let the league be tied,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let insolence no longer awe the throne;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, with a father's right, bestow your own.</div>
  <div class="i0">For this maligner of the general good,</div>
  <div class="i0">If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;</div>
  <div class="i0">His haughty godhead we with prayers implore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your sceptre to release, and our just rights restore.</div>
  <div class="i0">O cursed cause of all our ills! must we</div>
  <div class="i0">Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee?</div>
  <div class="i0">What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,</div>
  <div class="i0">And send us out to meet our certain fate?</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a destructive war: from Turnus' hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Our peace and public safety we demand.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;</div>
  <div class="i0">If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor will I much with your belief contend:</div>
  <div class="i0">I beg your greatness not to give the law</div>
  <div class="i0">In other realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.</div>
  <div class="i0">Pity your own, or pity our estate;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your interest is, the war should never cease;</div>
  <div class="i0">But we have felt enough, to wish the peace&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A land exhausted to the last remains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Depopulated towns, and driven plains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of power,</div>
  <div class="i0">A beauteous princess, with a crown in dower,</div>
  <div class="i0">So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,</div>
  <div class="i0">And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone!</div>
  <div class="i0">We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A base ignoble crowd, without a name,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unwept, unworthy of the funeral flame,</div>
  <div class="i0">By duty bound to forfeit each his life,</div>
  <div class="i0">That Turnus may possess a royal wife!</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Should share such triumphs, and detain from you</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The post of honour, your undoubted due.</div>
  <div class="i0">Rather alone your matchless force employ,</div>
  <div class="i0">To merit what alone you must enjoy."</div>
  <div class="i1">These words, so full of malice mixed with art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inflamed with rage the youthful hero's heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then groaning from the bottom of his breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">He heaved for wind, and thus his wrath expressed:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"You, Drances, never want a stream of words,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, when the public need requires our swords.</div>
  <div class="i0">First in the council-hall to steer the state,</div>
  <div class="i0">And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,</div>
  <div class="i0">While our strong walls secure us from the foe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Free leave is given him, when his fatal hand</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Has covered with more corps the sanguine strand,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And high as mine his towering trophies stand.</div>
  <div class="i0">If any doubt remains, who dares the most,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let us decide it at the Trojans' cost,</div>
  <div class="i0">And issue both a-breast, where honour calls&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">(Foes are not far to seek without the walls,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And feet were given him but to speed his flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">I beaten from the field? I forced away?</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?</div>
  <div class="i0">Had he but even beheld the fight, his eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">Had witnessed for me what his tongue denies&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And how the bloody Tyber swelled the main.</div>
  <div class="i0">All saw, but he, the Arcadian troops retire</div>
  <div class="i0">In scattered squadrons, and their prince expire.</div>
  <div class="i0">The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,</div>
  <div class="i0">I was not forced with ease to quit my ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclosed,</div>
  <div class="i0">I singly their united arms opposed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">First forced an entrance through their thick array,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a destructive war? So let it be,</div>
  <div class="i0">But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!</div>
  <div class="i0">Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears</div>
  <div class="i0">With false reports, their minds with panic fears:</div>
  <div class="i0">Extol the strength of a twice-conquered race;</div>
  <div class="i0">Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.</div>
  <div class="i0">Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town</div>
  <div class="i0">Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;</div>
  <div class="i0">Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Diomede from fierce Æneas flies!</div>
  <div class="i0">Say, rapid Aufidus with awful dread</div>
  <div class="i0">Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">When the great Trojan on his bank appears;</div>
  <div class="i0">For that's as true as thy dissembled fears</div>
  <div class="i0">Of my revenge: dismiss that vanity:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, Drances, art below a death from me.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;</div>
  <div class="i0">The lodging is well worthy of the guest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, royal father, to the present state</div>
  <div class="i0">Of our affairs, and of this high debate&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">If in your arms thus early you diffide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And think your fortune is already tried;</div>
  <div class="i0">If one defeat has brought us down so low,</div>
  <div class="i0">As never more in fields to meet the foe;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then I conclude for peace: 'tis time to treat,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lie like vassals at the victor's feet.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, oh! if any ancient blood remains,</div>
  <div class="i0">One drop of all our fathers, in our veins,</div>
  <div class="i0">That man would I prefer before the rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who dared his death with an undaunted breast;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who comely fell by no dishonest wound,</div>
  <div class="i0">To shun that sight, and, dying, gnawed the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,</div>
  <div class="i0">If our confederates can afford us more;</div>
  <div class="i0">If the contended field we bravely fought,</div>
  <div class="i0">And not a bloodless victory was bought;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their losses equalled ours; and, for their slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal fires they filled the shining plain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Why thus, unforced, should we so tamely yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?</div>
  <div class="i0">Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,</div>
  <div class="i0">Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some, raised aloft, come tumbling down amain;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.</div>
  <div class="i0">If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,</div>
  <div class="i0">The great Messapus yet remains our friend:</div>
  <div class="i0">Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours:</div>
  <div class="i0">The Italian chiefs, and princes, join their powers:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Nor least in number, nor in name the last,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your own brave subjects have our cause embraced.</div>
  <div class="i0">Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon</div>
  <div class="i0">Contains an army in herself alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">With glittering shields, in brazen armour bright.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And I alone the public peace withstand;</div>
  <div class="i0">If you consent, he shall not be refused,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor find a hand to victory unused.</div>
  <div class="i0">This new Achilles, let him take the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!</div>
  <div class="i0">For you, my royal father, and my fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">I, Turnus, not the least of all my name,</div>
  <div class="i0">Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand;</div>
  <div class="i0">And I alone will answer his demand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Drances shall rest secure, and neither share</div>
  <div class="i0">The danger, nor divide the prize, of war."</div>
  <div class="i1">While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas draws his forces to the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed</div>
  <div class="i0">Return, and through the frighted city spread</div>
  <div class="i0">The unpleasing news,&mdash;"The Trojans are descried,</div>
  <div class="i0">In battle marching by the river-side,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bending to the town." They take the alarm:</div>
  <div class="i0">Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.</div>
  <div class="i0">The impetuous youth press forward to the field;</div>
  <div class="i0">They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like that of swans remurmuring to the floods,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or birds of differing kinds in hollow woods.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus the occasion takes, and cries aloud:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:</div>
  <div class="i0">Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He said, and, turning short with speedy pace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command</div>
  <div class="i0">To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.</div>
  <div class="i0">Messapus, and Catillus, post your force</div>
  <div class="i0">Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some guard the passes, others man the wall;</div>
  <div class="i0">Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."</div>
  <div class="i1">They swarm from every quarter of the town,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with disordered haste the rampires crown.</div>
  <div class="i0">Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,</div>
  <div class="i0">The gathering storm just breaking on the state,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dismissed the council till a fitter time,</div>
  <div class="i0">And owned his easy temper as his crime,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, forced against his reason, had complied</div>
  <div class="i0">To break the treaty for the promised bride.</div>
  <div class="i1">Some help to sink new trenches; others aid</div>
  <div class="i0">To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hoarse trumpets sound the alarm; around the walls</div>
  <div class="i0">Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls.</div>
  <div class="i0">A sad procession in the streets is seen,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:</div>
  <div class="i0">High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,</div>
  <div class="i0">With downcast eyes appears the fatal bride.</div>
  <div class="i0">They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Prayers in their mouths, and presents in their hands.</div>
  <div class="i0">With censers, first they fume the sacred shrine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then in this common supplication join:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O patroness of arms! unspotted maid!</div>
  <div class="i0">Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!</div>
  <div class="i0">Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."</div>
  <div class="i1">Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast</div>
  <div class="i0">Well-tempered steel and scaly brass invest:</div>
  <div class="i0">The cuishes, which his brawny thighs infold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are mingled metal damasked o'er with gold.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">His faithful faulchion sits upon his side;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,</div>
  <div class="i0">With godlike grace, he from the tower descends.</div>
  <div class="i0">Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare</div>
  <div class="i0">His absent rival, and to promise war.</div>
  <div class="i1">Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,</div>
  <div class="i0">The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,</div>
  <div class="i0">And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or seeks his watering in the well-known flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:</div>
  <div class="i0">He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:</div>
  <div class="i0">He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;</div>
  <div class="i0">Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.</div>
  <div class="i1">Soon as the prince appears without the gate,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Volscians, and their virgin leader, wait</div>
  <div class="i0">His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:</div>
  <div class="i0">Her squadron imitates, and each descends;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"If sense of honour, if a soul secure</div>
  <div class="i0">Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,</div>
  <div class="i0">Can promise aught, or on itself rely</div>
  <div class="i0">Greatly to dare to conquer or to die;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, I alone, sustained by these, will meet</div>
  <div class="i0">The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:</div>
  <div class="i0">You, general, stay behind, and guard the town."</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And on the fierce virago fixed his eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus returned:&mdash;"O grace of Italy!</div>
  <div class="i0">With what becoming thanks can I reply?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not only words lie labouring in my breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">But thought itself is by thy praise oppressed.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Yet rob me not of all; but let me join</div>
  <div class="i0">My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan, not in stratagem unskilled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sends his light horse before to scour the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">Himself, through steep ascents and thorny brakes,</div>
  <div class="i0">A larger compass to the city takes.</div>
  <div class="i0">This news my scouts confirm: and I prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;</div>
  <div class="i0">With chosen foot his passage to forelay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And place an ambush in the winding way.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse:</div>
  <div class="i0">The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce</div>
  <div class="i0">With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,</div>
  <div class="i0">Subjected all to thy supreme command."</div>
  <div class="i1">This said, he warns Messapus to the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then every chief exhorts with equal care.</div>
  <div class="i0">All thus encouraged, his own troops he joins,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.</div>
  <div class="i1">Inclosed with hills, a winding valley lies,</div>
  <div class="i0">By nature formed for fraud, and fitted for surprise.</div>
  <div class="i0">A narrow track, by human steps untrode,</div>
  <div class="i0">Leads, through perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.</div>
  <div class="i0">High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.</div>
  <div class="i0">The top is level&mdash;an offensive seat</div>
  <div class="i0">Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:</div>
  <div class="i0">For, on the right and left, is room to press</div>
  <div class="i0">The foes at hand, or from afar distress;</div>
  <div class="i0">To drive them headlong downward; and to pour,</div>
  <div class="i0">On their descending backs, a stony shower.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Possessed the pass, and in blind ambush lay.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime, Latonian Ph&#339;&oelig;be, from the skies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beheld the approaching war with hateful eyes,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">And called the light-foot Opis to her aid,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her most beloved and ever-trusty maid;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then with a sigh began:&mdash;"Camilla goes</div>
  <div class="i0">To meet her death amidst her fatal foes&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The nymph I loved of all my mortal train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas born with her; and with her years it grew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her father Metabus, when forced away</div>
  <div class="i0">From old Privernum for tyrannic sway,</div>
  <div class="i0">Snatched up, and saved from his prevailing foes,</div>
  <div class="i0">This tender babe, companion of his woes.</div>
  <div class="i0">Casmilla was her mother; but he drowned</div>
  <div class="i0">One hissing letter in a softer sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">And called Camilla. Through the woods he flies;</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrapped in his robe the royal infant lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;</div>
  <div class="i0">With shouts and clamours they pursue the chase.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The banks of Amasene at length he gains:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The raging flood his farther flight restrains,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Raised o'er the borders with unusual rains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Prepared to plunge into the stream, he fears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.</div>
  <div class="i0">Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, desperate in distress, resolves at last.</div>
  <div class="i0">A knotty lance of well-boiled oak he bore;</div>
  <div class="i0">The middle part with cork he covered o'er:</div>
  <div class="i0">He closed the child within the hollow space;</div>
  <div class="i0">With twigs of bending osier bound the case,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then poised the spear, heavy with human weight,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus invoked my favour for the freight:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Accept, great goddess of the woods, (he said,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!</div>
  <div class="i0">Through air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;</div>
  <div class="i0">And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'</div>
  <div class="i0">He said; and with full force the spear he threw:</div>
  <div class="i0">Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then, pressed by foes, he stemmed the stormy tide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And gained, by stress of arms, the farther side.</div>
  <div class="i0">His fastened spear he pulled from out the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;</div>
  <div class="i0">Earth was his couch, his covering was the sky.</div>
  <div class="i0">On hills unshorn, or in a desert den,</div>
  <div class="i0">He shunned the dire society of men.</div>
  <div class="i0">A shepherd's solitary life he led;</div>
  <div class="i0">His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The dugs of bears, and every savage beast,</div>
  <div class="i0">He drew, and through her lips the liquor pressed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The little Amazon could scarcely go&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">He loads her with a quiver and a bow;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, that she might her staggering steps command,</div>
  <div class="i0">He with a slender javelin fills her hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Instead of these, a tyger's hide o'erspread</div>
  <div class="i0">Her back and shoulders, fastened to her head.</div>
  <div class="i0">The flying dart she first attempts to fling,</div>
  <div class="i0">And round her tender temples tossed the sling;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then, as her strength with years increased, began</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,</div>
  <div class="i0">To bless their rival sons with such a bride:</div>
  <div class="i0">But she disdains their love, to share with me</div>
  <div class="i0">The sylvan shades, and vowed virginity.</div>
  <div class="i0">And, oh! I wish, contented with my cares</div>
  <div class="i0">Of savage spoils, she had not sought the wars:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then had she been of my celestial train,</div>
  <div class="i0">And shunned the fate that dooms her to be slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">But since, opposing heaven's decree, she goes</div>
  <div class="i0">To find her death among forbidden foes,</div>

  <div class="i0">Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unspoiled shall be her arms, and unprofaned</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her holy limbs with any human hand,</div>

  <div class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She said. The faithful nymph descends from high&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:</div>

  <div class="i0">Drawn up in squadrons, with united force</div>
  <div class="i0">Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Shields, arms, and spears, flash horribly from far;</div>
  <div class="i0">And the fields glitter with a waving war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Opposed to these, come on with furious force</div>
  <div class="i0">Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;</div>
  <div class="i0">These in the body placed, on either hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Sustained and closed by fair Camilla's band.</div>
  <div class="i0">Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;</div>
  <div class="i0">And less and less the middle space appears.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen</div>
  <div class="i0">The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.</div>
  <div class="i0">In distance of their darts they stop their course;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.</div>
  <div class="i0">The face of heaven their flying javelins hide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus void of fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">By mettled coursers borne in full career,</div>
  <div class="i0">Meet first opposed; and, with a mighty shock,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their horses' heads against each other knock.</div>

  <div class="i0">Spurring at speed, to their own walls they drew;</div>
  <div class="i0">Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,</div>
  <div class="i0">And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, seized with shame, they wheel about, and face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Receive their foes, and raise a threatening cry.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.</div>
  <div class="i1">So swelling surges, with a thundering roar,</div>
  <div class="i0">Driven on each other's backs, insult the shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land,</div>
  <div class="i0">And far upon the beach eject the sand;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Repulsed from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal hurry quit the invaded shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">And swallow back the sand and stones they spewed before.</div>
  <div class="i0">Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,</div>

  <div class="i0">Him, from afar, she spied, in arms unknown:</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;</div>
  <div class="i0">His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread</div>
  <div class="i0">A covering for his cheeks, and grinned around his head.</div>

  <div class="i0">And towered above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.</div>

  <div class="i0">And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Vain hunter! didst thou think through woods to chase</div>

  <div class="i0">Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:</div>
  <div class="i0">A woman warrior was too strong for thee.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqueror's name,</div>
  <div class="i0">Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends</div>

  <div class="i0">Orsilochus, and she, their coursers ply:</div>

  <div class="i0">Recals each leader, by his name, from flight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Renews their ardour, and restores the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">"What panic fear has seized your souls? O shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">O brand perpetual of the Etrurian name!</div>
  <div class="i0">Cowards incurable! a woman's hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Drives, breaks, and scatters, your ignoble band!</div>
  <div class="i0">Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!</div>
  <div class="i0">What use of weapons which you dare not wield?</div>
  <div class="i0">Not thus you fly your female foes by night,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;</div>
  <div class="i0">When to fat offerings the glad augur calls,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the shrill horn-pipe sounds to bacchanals.</div>
  <div class="i0">These are your studied cares, your lewd delight&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not managing the life he meant to lose.</div>
  <div class="i0">The first he found he seized, with headlong haste,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his strong gripe, and clasped around the waist:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,</div>
  <div class="i0">And (laid athwart his own) in triumph bore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And view the unusual sight with vast surprise.</div>
  <div class="i0">The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pressed in his arms the ponderous prey sustains,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Then, with his shortened spear, explores around</div>
  <div class="i0">His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor less the captive struggles for his life:</div>
  <div class="i0">He writhes his body to prolong the strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts</div>
  <div class="i0">His utmost vigour, and the point averts.</div>
  <div class="i1">So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bears a speckled serpent through the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fastening his crooked talons on the prey:</div>
  <div class="i0">The prisoner hisses through the liquid way;</div>
  <div class="i0">Resists the royal hawk; and, though oppressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:</div>
  <div class="i0">Turned to her foe, she stiffens every scale,</div>
  <div class="i0">And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threatening tail.</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the victor, all defence is weak:</div>
  <div class="i0">The imperial bird still plies her with his beak;</div>
  <div class="i0">He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus, through the midst of circling enemies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strong Tarchon snatched and bore away his prize.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latins, and presume the like success.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Arruns, doomed to death, his arts essayed</div>
  <div class="i0">To murder, unespied, the Volscian maid:</div>
  <div class="i0">This way and that his winding course he bends,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, wheresoe'er she turns, her steps attends.</div>
  <div class="i0">When she retires victorious from the chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">He wheels about with care, and shifts his place:</div>
  <div class="i0">When, rushing on, she seeks her foes in fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:</div>
  <div class="i0">He threats, and trembles, trying every way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.</div>
  <div class="i1">Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glittering in Phrygian arms amidst the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was by the virgin viewed. The steed he pressed</div>
  <div class="i0">Was proud with trappings; and his brawny chest</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">With scales of gilded brass was covered o'er:</div>
  <div class="i0">A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.</div>
  <div class="i0">With deadly wounds he galled the distant foe;</div>
  <div class="i0">Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:</div>
  <div class="i0">A golden helm his front and head surrounds;</div>
  <div class="i0">A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gold, weaved with linen, on his thighs he wore,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With flowers of needle-work distinguished o'er,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With golden buckles bound, and gathered up before.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or that the temple might his trophies hold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.</div>
  <div class="i0">Blind in her haste, she chases him alone,</div>
  <div class="i0">And seeks his life, regardless of her own.</div>
  <div class="i0">This lucky moment the sly traitor chose;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,</div>
  <div class="i0">And threw, but first to heaven addressed his vows:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O patron of Soracte's high abodes!</div>
  <div class="i0">Ph&oelig;bus, the ruling power among the gods!</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom first we serve: whole woods of unctuous pine</div>
  <div class="i0">Are felled for thee, and to thy glory shine;</div>
  <div class="i0">By thee protected, with our naked soles,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through flames unsinged we march, and tread the kindled coals.</div>
  <div class="i0">Give me, propitious power, to wash away</div>
  <div class="i0">The stains of this dishonourable day:</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,</div>
  <div class="i0">But with my future actions trust my fame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from the field return inglorious home."</div>
  <div class="i1">Apollo heard, and, granting half his prayer,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shuffled in winds the rest, and tossed in empty air.</div>
  <div class="i0">He gives the death desired: his safe return</div>
  <div class="i0">By southern tempests to the seas is borne.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, when the javelin whizzed along the skies,</div>
  <div class="i0">Both armies on Camilla turned their eyes,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Directed by the sound. Of either host,</div>
  <div class="i0">The unhappy virgin, though concerned the most,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent</div>
  <div class="i0">On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till in her pap the winged weapon stood</div>
  <div class="i0">Infixed, and deeply drunk the purple blood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her sad attendants hasten to sustain</div>
  <div class="i0">Their dying lady drooping on the plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Far from their sight the trembling Arruns flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">With beating heart, and fear confused with joys;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or even to bear the sight of his expiring foe.</div>
  <div class="i1">As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide</div>
  <div class="i0">At unawares, or ranched a shepherd's side,</div>
  <div class="i0">Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And claps his quivering tail between his thighs:</div>
  <div class="i0">So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,</div>
  <div class="i0">But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.</div>
  <div class="i0">She wrenched the javelin with her dying hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">But wedged within her breast the weapon stands:</div>
  <div class="i0">The wood she draws, the steely point remains;</div>
  <div class="i0">She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains;</div>
  <div class="i0">(A gathering mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies;)</div>
  <div class="i0">Then turns to her, whom, of her female train,</div>
  <div class="i0">She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Acca, 'tis past! he swims before my sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inexorable Death; and claims his right.</div>
  <div class="i0">Bear my last words to Turnus: fly with speed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bid him timely to my charge succeed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."</div>
  <div class="i0">She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">Dying, her opened hand forsakes the rein;</div>
  <div class="i0">Short, and more short, she pants: by slow degrees</div>
  <div class="i0">Her mind the passage from her body frees.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Her mind the passage from her body frees.</div>
  <div class="i0">She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Her drooping head declining on her breast:</div>
  <div class="i0">In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, murmuring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.</div>
  <div class="i1">A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;</div>
  <div class="i0">Despair and rage, and languished fight renewed.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,</div>
  <div class="i0">Advance to charge; the mixed Arcadians join.</div>
  <div class="i1">But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar</div>
  <div class="i0">Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unmoved a while, till, prostrate on the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Weltering in blood, she sees Camilla slain,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew</div>
  <div class="i0">A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid!</div>
  <div class="i0">For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid:</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor aught availed, in this unhappy strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet unrevenged thy goddess will not leave</div>
  <div class="i0">Her votary's death, nor with vain sorrow grieve.</div>
  <div class="i0">Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorred;</div>
  <div class="i0">But after-ages shall thy praise record.</div>
  <div class="i0">The inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain."</div>
  <div class="i1">High o'er the field, there stood a hilly mound&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">A king that once in Latium bore the sway.</div>
  <div class="i0">The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">To mark the traitor Arruns from the height.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,</div>
  <div class="i0">Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;</div>
  <div class="i0">Turn, like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Charged with my message to Camilla go,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And say I sent thee to the shades below&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An honour undeserved from Cynthia's bow."</div>
  <div class="i1">She said, and from her quiver chose with speed</div>
  <div class="i0">The winged shaft, predestined for the deed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,</div>
  <div class="i0">Till the far distant horns approached on either side.</div>
  <div class="i0">The bow-string touched her breast, so strong she drew;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.</div>
  <div class="i0">At once the twanging bow and sounding dart</div>
  <div class="i0">The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">Him beating with his heels in pangs of death,</div>
  <div class="i0">His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.</div>
  <div class="i0">The conquering damsel, with expanded wings,</div>
  <div class="i0">The welcome message to her mistress brings.</div>
  <div class="i1">Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, unsustained, the chiefs of Turnus yield.</div>
  <div class="i0">The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">More on their speed than on their strength rely.</div>
  <div class="i0">Confused in flight, they bear each other down,</div>
  <div class="i0">And spur their horses headlong to the town.</div>
  <div class="i0">Driven by their foes, and to their fears resigned,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.</div>
  <div class="i0">These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or on their shoulders bear the slackened bow.</div>
  <div class="i0">The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er the darkened walls and rampires fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rend heaven with female shrieks, and wring their hands.</div>
  <div class="i0">All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are crushed in crowds, a mingled multitude.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some happy few escape: the throng too late</div>
  <div class="i0">Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.</div>
  <div class="i0">Even in the sight of home, the wretched sire</div>
  <div class="i0">Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,</div>
  <div class="i0">But leave their friends excluded with their foes.</div>
  <div class="i0">The vanquished cry; the victors loudly shout;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis terror all within, and slaughter all without.</div>
  <div class="i0">Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Armed on the towers, the common danger share:</div>
  <div class="i0">So much of zeal their country's cause inspired;</div>
  <div class="i0">So much Camilla's great example fired.</div>
  <div class="i0">Poles, sharpened in the flames, from high they throw,</div>
  <div class="i0">With imitated darts to gall the foe.</div>
  <div class="i0">Their lives, for godlike freedom, they bequeath,</div>
  <div class="i0">And crowd each other to be first in death.</div>
  <div class="i0">Meantime to Turnus, ambushed in the shade,</div>
  <div class="i0">With heavy tidings came the unhappy maid:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The Volscians overthrown&mdash;Camilla killed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The foes entirely masters of the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:</div>
  <div class="i0">The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."</div>
  <div class="i1">Inflamed with rage, (for so the Furies fire</div>
  <div class="i0">The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,)</div>
  <div class="i0">He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">Possessed, and downward issues on the plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed</div>
  <div class="i0">From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Through the black forest and the ferny brake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Unknowingly secure, their way they take,</div>
  <div class="i0">From the rough mountains to the plain descend,</div>
  <div class="i0">And there, in order drawn, their line extend.</div>
  <div class="i0">Both armies now in open fields are seen;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not far the distance of the space between.</div>
  <div class="i0">Both to the city bend. Æneas sees,</div>
  <div class="i0">Through smoking fields, his hastening enemies;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Through smoking fields, his hastening enemies;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Turnus views the Trojans in array,</div>
  <div class="i0">And hears the approaching horses proudly neigh.</div>
  <div class="i0">Soon had their hosts in bloody battle joined;</div>
  <div class="i0">But westward to the sea the sun declined.</div>
  <div class="i0">Intrenched before the town, both armies lie,</div>
  <div class="i0">While night with sable wings involves the sky.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their armies broken, and their courage quelled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Himself become the mark of public spite,</div>
  <div class="i0">His honour questioned for the promised fight&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The more he was with vulgar hate oppressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The more his fury boiled within his breast:</div>
  <div class="i0">He roused his vigour for the last debate,</div>
  <div class="i0">And raised his haughty soul, to meet his fate.</div>
  <div class="i1">As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if the pointed javelin pierce his side,</div>
  <div class="i0">The lordly beast returns with double pride:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain,</div>
  <div class="i0">His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:</div>
  <div class="i0">So Turnus fares: his eyeballs flash with fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Through his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.</div>
  <div class="i1">Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,</div>
  <div class="i0">At length approached the king, and thus began:&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"No more excuses or delays: I stand</div>

  <div class="i0">The same conditions which himself did make.</div>
  <div class="i0">Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to my single virtue trust the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latians unconcerned shall see the fight:</div>
  <div class="i0">This arm unaided shall assert your right:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,</div>

  <div class="i1">To whom the king sedately thus replied:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"Brave youth! the more your valour has been tried,</div>
  <div class="i0">The more becomes it us, with due respect,</div>
  <div class="i0">To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.</div>
  <div class="i0">You want not wealth, or a successive throne,</div>

  <div class="i0">Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,</div>
  <div class="i0">But sound advice, proceeding from a heart</div>
  <div class="i0">Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.</div>
  <div class="i0">The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,</div>
  <div class="i0">No prince, Italian born, should heir my throne:</div>
  <div class="i0">Oft have our augurs, in prediction skilled,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oft our priests, a foreign son revealed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bribed by my kindness to my kindred blood,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Urged by my wife, who would not be denied,</div>

  <div class="i0">If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,</div>
  <div class="i0">Why should I not procure it whilst you live?</div>

  <div class="i1">Such balmy words he poured, but all in vain:</div>
  <div class="i0">The proffered medicine but provoked the pain.</div>
  <div class="i0">The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,</div>
  <div class="i0">With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The care, O best of fathers! which you take</div>
  <div class="i0">For my concerns, at my desire forsake.</div>
  <div class="i0">Permit me not to languish out my days,</div>
  <div class="i0">But make the best exchange of life for praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;</div>
  <div class="i0">And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.</div>
  <div class="i0">His goddess mother is not near, to shrowd</div>
  <div class="i0">The flying coward with an empty cloud."</div>
  <div class="i1">But now the queen, who feared for Turnus' life,</div>
  <div class="i0">And loathed the hard conditions of the strife,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Held him by force; and, dying in his death,</div>
  <div class="i0">In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O Turnus! I adjure thee by these tears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And whate'er price Amata's honour bears</div>
  <div class="i0">Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,</div>
  <div class="i0">My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Since on the safety of thy life alone</div>
  <div class="i0">Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Refuse me not this one, this only prayer,</div>
  <div class="i0">To wave the combat, and pursue the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.</div>
  <div class="i0">I cannot live a slave, or see my throne</div>
  <div class="i0">Usurped by strangers, or a Trojan son."</div>

  <div class="i0">Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,</div>
  <div class="i0">Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.</div>
  <div class="i1">Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"O mother! do not by your tears prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolved on fight, I am no longer free</div>
  <div class="i0">To shun my death, if heaven my death decree."&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:</div>
  <div class="i0">"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;</div>

  <div class="i0">Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:</div>
  <div class="i0">Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to the victor be the beauteous bride."</div>
  <div class="i1">He said, and, striding on with speedy pace,</div>
  <div class="i0">He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.</div>
  <div class="i0">At his approach, they toss their heads on high,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, proudly neighing, promise victory.</div>
  <div class="i0">The sires of these Orithyia sent from far,</div>
  <div class="i0">To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.</div>
  <div class="i0">The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Officious grooms stand ready by his side;</div>

  <div class="i1">He sheathed his limbs in arms; a tempered mass</div>
  <div class="i0">Of golden metal those, and mountain-brass.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to his head his glittering helm he tied,</div>
  <div class="i0">And girt his faithful faulchion to his side.</div>
  <div class="i0">In his Ætnæan forge, the god of fire</div>
  <div class="i0">That faulchion laboured for the hero's sire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Immortal keenness on the blade bestowed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plunged it hissing in the Stygian flood.</div>
  <div class="i0">Propped on a pillar, which the cieling bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was placed the lance Auruncan Actor wore;</div>
  <div class="i0">Which with such force he brandished in his hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then cried,&mdash;"O ponderous spoil of Actor slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And never yet by Turnus tossed in vain!</div>
  <div class="i0">Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,</div>

  <div class="i1">Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies</div>
  <div class="i0">A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">So fares the bull in his loved female's sight:</div>

  <div class="i0">And meditates his absent enemy:</div>
  <div class="i0">He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand</div>
  <div class="i0">With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">To future fight his manly courage warms:</div>
  <div class="i0">He whets his fury, and with joy prepares</div>
  <div class="i0">To terminate at once the lingering wars;</div>
  <div class="i0">To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates</div>
  <div class="i0">What heaven had promised, and expounds the fates.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease</div>
  <div class="i0">The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.</div>
  <div class="i1">The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,</div>

  <div class="i0">The etherial coursers, bounding from the sea,</div>
  <div class="i0">From out their flaming nostrils breathed the day;</div>
  <div class="i0">When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beneath the walls, they measure out the space;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where, with religious rites, their common gods they place.</div>
  <div class="i0">In purest white, the priests their heads attire,</div>
  <div class="i0">And living waters bear, and holy fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,</div>
  <div class="i0">Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear.</div>
  <div class="i1">In order issuing from the town, appears</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latin legion, armed with pointed spears;</div>
  <div class="i0">And from the fields, advancing on a line,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their various arms afford a pleasing sight:</div>
  <div class="i0">A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepared for fight.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glittering with gold, and vests in purple dyed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,</div>
  <div class="i0">And there Messapus, born of seed divine.</div>
  <div class="i0">The sign is given; and, round the listed space,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each man in order fills his proper place.</div>
  <div class="i0">Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And fix their pointed lances in the sand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, studious of the sight, a numerous throng</div>
  <div class="i0">Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,</div>
  <div class="i0">Swarm from the town: by those who rest behind,</div>
  <div class="i0">The gates and walls, and houses' tops, are lined.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime the queen of heaven beheld the sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">With eyes unpleased, from mount Albano's height:</div>
  <div class="i0">(Since called Albano by succeeding fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">But then an empty hill, without a name.)</div>
  <div class="i0">She thence surveyed the field, the Trojan powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine towers.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus the goddess of the skies bespake,</div>
  <div class="i0">With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,</div>
  <div class="i0">King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betrayed&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Compressed by force, but, by the grateful god,</div>
  <div class="i0">Now made the Naïs of the neighbouring flood.</div>
  <div class="i0">"O nymph, the pride of living lakes! (said she)</div>
  <div class="i0">O most renowned, and most beloved by me!</div>
  <div class="i0">Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,</div>
  <div class="i0">The wanton sallies of my wandering lord.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of every Latian fair, whom Jove misled</div>
  <div class="i0">To mount by stealth my violated bed,</div>
  <div class="i0">To thee alone I grudged not his embrace,</div>
  <div class="i0">But gave a part of heaven, and an unenvied place.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor think my wishes want to thy relief</div>
  <div class="i0">While fortune favoured, nor heaven's king denied</div>
  <div class="i0">To lend my succour to the Latian side,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I saved thy brother, and the sinking state:</div>
  <div class="i0">But now he struggles with unequal fate,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatched in might,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To meet inevitable death in fight;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, if thou dar'st, thy present aid supply;</div>
  <div class="i0">It well becomes a sister's care to try."</div>
  <div class="i1">At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.</div>
  <div class="i0">To whom Saturnia thus:&mdash;"Thy tears are late:</div>
  <div class="i0">Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatched, from fate:</div>
  <div class="i0">New tumults kindle; violate the truce.</div>
  <div class="i0">Who knows what changeful Fortune may produce?</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not a crime to attempt what I decree;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."</div>
  <div class="i0">She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.</div>
  <div class="i1">And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear:</div>
  <div class="i0">Twelve golden beams around his temples play,</div>
  <div class="i0">To mark his lineage from the god of day.</div>
  <div class="i0">Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in his hand two massy spears he shook:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, author of the Roman line;</div>
  <div class="i0">And by his side Ascanius took his place,</div>
  <div class="i0">The second hope of Rome's immortal race.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Adorned in white, a reverend priest appears,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And offerings to the flaming altars bears&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A porket, and a lamb that never suffered shears.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And strews the beasts, designed for sacrifice,</div>
  <div class="i0">With salt and meal: with like officious care</div>
  <div class="i0">He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;</div>
  <div class="i0">With the same generous juice the flame he feeds.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Æneas then unsheathed his shining sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thus with pious prayers the gods adored:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i1">"All-seeing sun! and thou, Ausonian soil,</div>
  <div class="i0">For which I have sustained so long a toil,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, king of heaven! and thou, the queen of air,</div>
  <div class="i0">Propitious now, and reconciled by prayer;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou, god of war, whose unresisted sway</div>
  <div class="i0">The labours and events of arms obey!</div>
  <div class="i0">Ye living fountains, and ye running floods!</div>
  <div class="i0">All powers of ocean, all etherial gods!</div>
  <div class="i0">Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">My Trojans shall increase Evander's town;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ascanius shall renounce the Ausonian crown:</div>
  <div class="i0">All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)</div>
  <div class="i0">My Trojans shall not o'er the Italians reign;</div>
  <div class="i0">Both equal, both unconquered, shall remain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Joined in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;</div>
  <div class="i0">I ask but altars for my weary gods.</div>
  <div class="i0">The care of those religious rites be mine:</div>
  <div class="i0">The crown to king Latinus I resign:</div>
  <div class="i0">His be the sovereign sway. Nor will I share</div>
  <div class="i0">His power in peace, or his command in war.</div>
  <div class="i0">For me, my friends another town shall frame,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bless the rising towers with fair Lavinia's name."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Latian king before his altar stands.</div>
  <div class="i0">"By the same heaven, (said he,) and earth, and main,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all the powers that all the three contain;</div>
  <div class="i0">By hell below, and by that upper god,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;</div>
  <div class="i0">So let Latona's double offspring hear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,</div>
  <div class="i0">And all those powers attest, and all their names:</div>
  <div class="i0">Whatever chance befal on either side,</div>
  <div class="i0">No term of time this union shall divide:</div>
  <div class="i0">No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or shake the stedfast tenor of my mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not, though the circling seas should break their bound,</div>
  <div class="i0">O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not, though the lamps of heaven their spheres forsake,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hurled down, and hissing in the nether lake:</div>
  <div class="i0">Even as this royal sceptre" (for he bore</div>
  <div class="i0">A sceptre in his hand) "shall never more</div>
  <div class="i0">Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">An orphan now, cut from the mother earth</div>
  <div class="i0">By the keen axe, dishonoured of its hair,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cased in brass, for Latian kings to bear."</div>
  <div class="i1">When thus in public view the peace was tied</div>
  <div class="i0">With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,</div>
  <div class="i0">All dues performed which holy rites require,</div>
  <div class="i0">The victim beasts are slain before the fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne.</div>
  <div class="i1">Already the Rutulians deemed their man</div>
  <div class="i0">O'ermatched in arms, before the fight began.</div>
  <div class="i0">First rising fears are whispered through the crowd;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, gathering sound, they murmur more aloud.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes</div>
  <div class="i0">The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:</div>
  <div class="i0">The nearer they approach, the more is known</div>
  <div class="i0">The apparent disadvantage of their own.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus himself appears in public sight</div>
  <div class="i0">Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands</div>
  <div class="i0">With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands:</div>
  <div class="i0">And, while he mutters undistinguished prayers,</div>
  <div class="i0">A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.</div>
  <div class="i1">With anxious pleasure when Juturna viewed</div>
  <div class="i0">The increasing fright of the mad multitude,</div>
  <div class="i0">When their short sighs and thickening sobs she heard,</div>
  <div class="i0">And found their ready minds for change prepared;</div>
  <div class="i0">Dissembling her immortal form, she took</div>
  <div class="i0">Camertes' mien, his habit, and his look&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">A chief of ancient blood:&mdash;in arms well known</div>
  <div class="i0">Was his great sire, and he his greater son.</div>
  <div class="i0">His shape assumed, amid the ranks she ran,</div>
  <div class="i0">And humouring their first motions, thus began:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"For shame, Rutulians! can you bear the sight</div>
  <div class="i0">Of one exposed for all, in single fight?</div>
  <div class="i0">Can we, before the face of heaven, confess</div>
  <div class="i0">Our courage colder, or our numbers less?</div>
  <div class="i0">View all the Trojan host, the Arcadian band,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Tuscan army; count them as they stand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Undaunted to the battle if we go,</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce every second man will share a foe.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus, 'tis true, in this unequal strife,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall lose, with honour, his devoted life,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or change it rather for immortal fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:</div>
  <div class="i0">But you, a servile and inglorious band,</div>
  <div class="i0">For foreign lords shall sow your native land,</div>
  <div class="i0">Those fruitful fields, your fighting fathers gained,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which have so long their lazy sons sustained."</div>
  <div class="i1">With words like these, she carried her design.</div>
  <div class="i0">A rising murmur runs along the line.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then even the city troops, and Latians, tired</div>
  <div class="i0">With tedious war, seem with new souls inspired:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their champion's fate with pity they lament,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage</div>
  <div class="i0">With lying wonders, and a false presage;</div>
  <div class="i0">But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,</div>
  <div class="i0">Appears in pomp the imperial bird of Jove:</div>
  <div class="i0">A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his strong talons trussed a silver swan.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Italians wonder at the unusual sight:</div>
  <div class="i0">But while he lags, and labours in his flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with united force the foe pursue:</div>
  <div class="i0">Clamorous around the royal hawk they fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, thickening in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.</div>
  <div class="i0">They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor can the encumbered bird sustain their force;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, vexed, not vanquished, drops the ponderous prey,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, lightened of his burden, wings his way.</div>
  <div class="i1">The Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Eager of action, and demand the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then king Tolumnius, versed in augurs' arts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"At length 'tis granted, what I long desired!</div>
  <div class="i0">This, this is what my frequent vows required.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ye gods! I take your omen, and obey.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.</div>
  <div class="i0">These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:</div>
  <div class="i0">But soon, like him, they shall be forced to sea</div>
  <div class="i0">By strength united, and forego the prey.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your timely succour to your country bring;</div>
  <div class="i0">Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."</div>
  <div class="i1">He said: and, pressing onward through the crew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Poised in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.</div>
  <div class="i0">The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Came driving on, nor missed the mark designed.</div>
  <div class="i0">At once the cornel rattled in the skies;</div>
  <div class="i0">At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Born of Arcadian mixed with Tuscan blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gylippus' sons; the fatal javelin flew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Aimed at the midmost of the friendly crew.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A passage through the jointed arms it found,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Just where the belt was to the body bound,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, fired with pious rage, the generous train</div>
  <div class="i0">Run madly forward to revenge the slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">And some with eager haste their javelins throw;</div>
  <div class="i0">And some with sword in hand assault the foe.</div>
  <div class="i1">The wished insult the Latine troops embrace,</div>
  <div class="i0">And meet their ardour in the middle space.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal courage obviate their design.</div>
  <div class="i0">Peace leaves the violated fields; and hate</div>
  <div class="i0">Both armies urges to their mutual fate.</div>
  <div class="i0">With impious haste their altars are o'erturned,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sacrifice half broiled, and half unburned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thick storms of steel from either army fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;</div>
  <div class="i0">Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,</div>
  <div class="i0">With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bears his unregarded gods away.</div>
  <div class="i0">These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.</div>
  <div class="i1">Messapus, eager to confound the peace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Spurred his hot courser through the fighting prease,</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At king Aulestes, by his purple known</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, with a shock encountering, bore him down.</div>
  <div class="i0">Backward he fell; and, as his fate designed,</div>
  <div class="i0">The ruins of an altar were behind:</div>
  <div class="i0">There pitching on his shoulders and his head,</div>
  <div class="i0">Amid the scattering fires he lay supinely spread.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Amid the scattering fires he lay supinely spread.</div>
  <div class="i0">The beamy spear, descending from above,</div>
  <div class="i0">His cuirass pierced, and through his body drove.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."</div>
  <div class="i0">Greedy of spoils, the Italians strip the dead</div>
  <div class="i0">Of his rich armour, and uncrown his head.</div>
  <div class="i1">Priest Corynæus armed his better hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">From his own altar, with a blazing brand;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, as Ebusus with a thundering pace</div>
  <div class="i0">Advanced to battle, dashed it on his face:</div>
  <div class="i0">His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;</div>
  <div class="i0">The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.</div>
  <div class="i0">Following the blow, he seized his curling crown</div>
  <div class="i0">With his left hand; his other cast him down.</div>
  <div class="i0">The prostrate body with his knees he pressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plunged his holy poignard in his breast.</div>
  <div class="i1">While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued</div>
  <div class="i0">The shepherd Alsus through the flying crowd,</div>
  <div class="i0">Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow</div>
  <div class="i0">Full on the front of his unwary foe.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The broad axe enters with a crashing sound,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around.</div>
  <div class="i0">An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sealed their heavy lids in endless rest.</div>
  <div class="i0">But good Æneas rushed amid the bands;</div>
  <div class="i0">Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Inflames your altered minds? O Trojans! cease</div>
  <div class="i0">From impious arms, nor violate the peace.</div>
  <div class="i0">By human sanctions, and by laws divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;</div>
  <div class="i0">This hand alone shall right the gods and you:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Our injured altars, and their broken vow,</div>
  <div class="i0">To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe."</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defence,</div>
  <div class="i0">A winged arrow struck the pious prince.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, whether from some human hand it came,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:</div>
  <div class="i0">No human hand, or hostile god, was found,</div>
  <div class="i0">To boast the triumph of so base a wound.</div>
  <div class="i0">When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">His chiefs dismayed, his troops a fainting train,</div>
  <div class="i0">The unhoped event his heightened soul inspires:</div>
  <div class="i0">At once his arms and coursers he requires;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a ready hand assumes the reins.</div>
  <div class="i0">He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes,</div>
  <div class="i0">He leaves behind a lane of slaughtered foes.</div>
  <div class="i0">These his lance reaches; over those he rolls</div>
  <div class="i0">His rapid car, and crushes out their souls.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain the vanquished fly: the victor sends</div>
  <div class="i0">The dead men's weapons at their living friends.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">The god of battles, in his angry mood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lets loose the reins, and scours along the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;</div>
  <div class="i0">Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair,</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Friends of the god, and followers of the war.</div>
  <div class="i1">With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,</div>
  <div class="i0">He lashes on; and urges o'er the dead.</div>
  <div class="i0">Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,</div>
  <div class="i0">The gore and gathering dust are dashed around.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,</div>
  <div class="i0">He killed at hand, but Sthenelus afar:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">From far the sons of Imbrasus he slew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Both taught to fight on foot, in battle joined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">New fired the Trojans, and their foes repelled.</div>
  <div class="i0">This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name,</div>
  <div class="i0">But emulated more his father's fame&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Grecian camp and order to descry&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard enterprise! and well he might require</div>
  <div class="i0">Achilles' car and horses, for his hire:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, met upon the scout, the Ætolian prince</div>
  <div class="i0">In death bestowed a juster recompense.</div>
  <div class="i1">Fierce Turnus viewed the Trojan from afar,</div>
  <div class="i0">And launched his javelin from his lofty car,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wrenched from his feeble hold the shining sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">And plunged it in the bosom of its lord.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"</div>
  <div class="i1">Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris, he slew,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom o'er his neck the floundering courser threw.</div>
  <div class="i0">As when loud Boreas, with his blustering train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before,</div>
  <div class="i0">And rolls the billows on the Ægæan shore:</div>
  <div class="i0">So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,</div>
  <div class="i0">The scattered squadrons bend before his force:</div>
  <div class="i0">His crest of horses hair is blown behind</div>
  <div class="i0">By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, as the chariot rolled along the plain,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Light from the ground he leapt, and seized the rein.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Thus hung in air, he still retained his hold,</div>
  <div class="i0">The coursers frighted, and their course controuled.</div>
  <div class="i0">The lance of Turnus reached him as he hung,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pierced his plated arms, but passed along,</div>
  <div class="i0">And only razed the skin. He turned, and held</div>
  <div class="i0">Against his threatening foe his ample shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then called for aid: but, while he cried in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">The chariot bore him backward on the plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">He lies reversed; the victor king descends,</div>
  <div class="i0">And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,</div>
  <div class="i0">He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk</div>
  <div class="i0">With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.</div>
  <div class="i1">While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">The wounded prince is forced to leave the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,</div>
  <div class="i0">And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,</div>
  <div class="i0">Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear</div>
  <div class="i0">His limbs from earth, supported on his spear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolved in mind, regardless of the smart,</div>
  <div class="i0">He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.</div>
  <div class="i0">The steel remains. No readier way he found</div>
  <div class="i0">To draw the weapon, than to enlarge the wound.</div>
  <div class="i0">Eager of fight, impatient of delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.</div>
  <div class="i1">Iäpis was at hand to prove his art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose blooming youth so fired Apollo's heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">That, for his love, he proffered to bestow</div>
  <div class="i0">His tuneful harp, and his unerring bow:</div>
  <div class="i0">The pious youth, more studious how to save</div>
  <div class="i0">His aged sire now sinking to the grave,</div>
  <div class="i0">Preferred the power of plants, and silent praise</div>
  <div class="i0">Of healing arts, before Ph&oelig;bean bays.</div>
  <div class="i1">Propped on his lance the pensive hero stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">And heard and saw, unmoved, the mourning crowd.</div>
  <div class="i0">The famed physician tucks his robes around</div>
  <div class="i0">With ready hands, and hastens to the wound.</div>

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With gentle touches he performs his part,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This way and that, soliciting the dart,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And exercises all his heavenly art.</div>
  <div class="i0">All softening simples, known of sovereign use,</div>
  <div class="i0">He presses out, and pours their noble juice.</div>
  <div class="i0">These first infused, to lenify the pain&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then to the patron of his art he prayed:</div>
  <div class="i0">The patron of his art refused his aid.</div>
  <div class="i1">Meantime the war approaches to the tents:</div>
  <div class="i0">The alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The driving dust proclaims the danger near;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And first their friends, and then their foes, appear:</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.</div>
  <div class="i0">The camp is filled with terror and affright:</div>
  <div class="i0">The hissing shafts within the trench alight;</div>
  <div class="i0">An undistinguished noise ascends the sky&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die.</div>
  <div class="i1">But now the goddess mother, moved with grief,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pierced with pity, hastens her relief.</div>
  <div class="i0">A branch of healing dittany she brought,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">(Rough is the stem, which woolly leaves surround;</div>

  <div class="i0">Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief</div>

  <div class="i0">This Venus brings, in clouds involved, and brews</div>
  <div class="i0">The extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,</div>
  <div class="i0">And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tempering the mixture with her heavenly hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pours it in a bowl, already crowned</div>
  <div class="i0">With juice of medicinal herbs prepared to bathe the wound.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The leech, unknowing of superior art</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Stanched is the blood, and in the bottom stands:</div>

  <div class="i0">This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some god our general to the battle sends;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some god preserves his life for greater ends."</div>
  <div class="i1">The hero arms in haste: his hands enfold</div>
  <div class="i0">His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:</div>

  <div class="i0">This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes,</div>
  <div class="i0">That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.</div>

  <div class="i1">He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Antheus and Mnestheus, and a numerous train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Attend his steps: the rest their weapons take,</div>

  <div class="i1">Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far</div>
  <div class="i0">Beheld the progress of the moving war:</div>
  <div class="i0">With him the Latins viewed the covered plains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.</div>
  <div class="i0">Juturna saw the advancing troops appear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,</div>
  <div class="i0">Closed in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.</div>
  <div class="i0">As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore</div>
  <div class="i0">From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;</div>
  <div class="i0">The painful hind with heavy heart foresees</div>
  <div class="i0">The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;</div>
  <div class="i0">With such impetuous rage the prince appears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.</div>
  <div class="i0">And now both armies shock in open field;</div>
  <div class="i0">Osiris is by strong Thymbræus killed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain,</div>
  <div class="i0">(All famed in arms, and of the Latian train,)</div>
  <div class="i0">By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand.</div>
  <div class="i0">The fatal augur falls, by whose command</div>
  <div class="i0">The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued</div>
  <div class="i0">With Trojan blood, the unhappy fight renewed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky;</div>
  <div class="i0">And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few.</div>
  <div class="i0">Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Juturna heard, and, seized with mortal fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forced from the beam her brother's charioteer;</div>
  <div class="i0">Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.</div>
  <div class="i1">As the black swallow near the palace plies;</div>
  <div class="i0">O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,</div>
  <div class="i0">To furnish her loquacious nest with food:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;</div>
  <div class="i0">The smoking horses run with loosened reins.</div>
  <div class="i0">She steers a various course among the foes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now here, now there, her conquering brother shows;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas, fired with fury, breaks the crowd,</div>
  <div class="i0">And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:</div>
  <div class="i0">He runs within a narrower ring, and tries</div>
  <div class="i0">To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.</div>
  <div class="i0">If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,</div>
  <div class="i0">And far away the Daunian hero bears.</div>
  <div class="i1">What should he do? Nor arts nor arms avail;</div>
  <div class="i0">And various cares in vain his mind assail.</div>
  <div class="i0">The great Messapus, thundering through the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his left hand two pointed javelins held:</div>
  <div class="i0">Encountering on the prince, one dart he drew,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with unerring aim, and utmost vigour, threw.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas saw it come, and, stooping low</div>
  <div class="i0">Beneath his buckler, shunned the threat'ning blow.</div>
  <div class="i0">The weapon hissed above his head, and tore</div>
  <div class="i0">The waving plume, which on his helm he wore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Forced by this hostile act, and fired with spite,</div>
  <div class="i0">That flying Turnus still declined the fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">The prince, whose piety had long repelled</div>
  <div class="i0">His inborn ardour, now invades the field;</div>
  <div class="i0">Invokes the powers of violated peace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their rites and injured altars to redress;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,</div>
  <div class="i0">With blood and slaughtered bodies fills the plain.</div>

  <div class="i0">Betwixt his ribs the javelin drove so just,</div>
  <div class="i0">It reached his heart, nor needs a second thrust.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;</div>
  <div class="i0">First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assailed</div>
  <div class="i0">Diores, and in equal fight prevailed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.</div>
  <div class="i1">Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whom without respite at one charge he slew:</div>
  <div class="i0">Cethegus, Tanaïs, Talus, fell oppressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sad Onytes, added to the rest&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.</div>
  <div class="i1">Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from Apollo's fane to battle sent,</div>
  <div class="i0">O'erthrew; nor Ph&oelig;bus could their fate prevent.</div>
  <div class="i0">Peaceful Men&oelig;tes after these he killed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who long had shunned the dangers of the field:</div>
  <div class="i0">On Lerna's lake a silent life he led,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with his nets and angle earned his bread.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,</div>
  <div class="i0">But wisely from the infectious world withdrew.</div>
  <div class="i0">Poor was his house: his father's painful hand</div>
  <div class="i0">Discharged his rent, and ploughed another's land.</div>
  <div class="i1">As flames among the lofty woods are thrown</div>
  <div class="i0">On different sides, and both by winds are blown;</div>
  <div class="i0">The laurels crackle in the sputtering fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:</div>

  <div class="i0">And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.</div>
  <div class="i0">Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;</div>
  <div class="i0">And hearts are pierced, unknowing how to yield:</div>
  <div class="i0">They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;</div>
  <div class="i0">And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.</div>
  <div class="i1">Murrhanus, boasting of his blood, that springs</div>
  <div class="i0">From a long royal race of Latian kings,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,</div>
  <div class="i0">Crushed with the weight of an unwieldy stone:</div>
  <div class="i0">Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore</div>
  <div class="i0">His living load, his dying body tore.</div>
  <div class="i0">His starting steeds, to shun the glittering sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord.</div>
  <div class="i1">Fierce Hyllus threatened high, and, face to face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Affronted Turnus in the middle space:</div>
  <div class="i0">The prince encountered him in full career,</div>
  <div class="i0">And at his temples aimed the deadly spear:</div>
  <div class="i0">So fatally the flying weapon sped,</div>
  <div class="i0">That through his brazen helm it pierced his head.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor, Cisseus, could'st thou 'scape from Turnus' hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain the strongest of the Arcadian band:</div>

  <div class="i0">Availing aid against the Ænean sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which to his naked heart pursued the course;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.</div>
  <div class="i1">Iölas fell, whom not the Grecian powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor great subverter of the Trojan towers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were doomed to kill, while heaven prolonged his date:</div>
  <div class="i0">But who can pass the bounds prefixed by Fate?</div>
  <div class="i0">In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held</div>
  <div class="i0">Two palaces, and was from each expelled:</div>

  <div class="i0">In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">He views the unguarded city from afar,</div>
  <div class="i0">In careless quiet, and secure of war.</div>
  <div class="i0">Occasion offers, and excites his mind</div>
  <div class="i0">To dare beyond the task he first designed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolved, he calls his chiefs: they leave the fight:</div>
  <div class="i0">Attended thus, he takes a neighbouring height:</div>
  <div class="i0">The crowding troops about their general stand,</div>
  <div class="i0">All under arms, and wait his high command.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then thus the lofty prince:&mdash;"Hear and obey,</div>

  <div class="i0">The people shall be slaves, unless in time</div>
  <div class="i0">They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.</div>
  <div class="i0">Twice have our foes been vanquished on the plain:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?</div>
  <div class="i0">Your force against the perjured city bend;</div>
  <div class="i0">There it began, and there the war shall end;</div>

  <div class="i1">He finished; and&mdash;one soul inspiring all&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Formed in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.</div>
  <div class="i0">Without the town, an unprovided train</div>
  <div class="i0">Of gaping gazing citizens are slain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some firebrands, others scaling ladders, bear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:</div>
  <div class="i0">The flames now launched, the feathered arrows fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.</div>
  <div class="i0">Advancing to the front, the hero stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, stretching out to heaven his pious hands,</div>
  <div class="i0">Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,</div>
  <div class="i0">Upbraids with breach of faith the Ausonian prince;</div>
  <div class="i0">Declares the royal honour doubly stained,</div>
  <div class="i0">And twice the rites of holy peace profaned.</div>
  <div class="i1">Dissenting clamours in the town arise:</div>
  <div class="i0">Each will be heard, and all at once advise.</div>
  <div class="i0">One part for peace, and one for war, contends:</div>
  <div class="i0">Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends.</div>
  <div class="i0">The helpless king is hurried in the throng,</div>
  <div class="i0">And (whate'er tide prevails) is borne along.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,</div>
  <div class="i0">Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,</div>
  <div class="i0">They run around, or labour on their wings,</div>
  <div class="i0">Disused to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;</div>
  <div class="i0">To shun the bitter fumes, in vain they try;</div>
  <div class="i0">Black vapours, issuing from the vent, involve the sky.</div>
  <div class="i1">But Fate and envious Fortune now prepare</div>
  <div class="i0">To plunge the Latins in the last despair.</div>
  <div class="i0">The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,</div>
  <div class="i0">And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,</div>

  <div class="i0">Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,</div>

  <div class="i0">And owns the dire effects of her ungoverned will:</div>

  <div class="i0">She tears with both her hands her purple vest:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then round a beam a running noose she tied,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, fastened by the neck, obscenely died.</div>

  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And much he blames the softness of his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Obnoxious to the charms of woman-kind,</div>

  <div class="i0">To break the solemn league so long desired,</div>

  <div class="i1">Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.</div>
  <div class="i0">His flying coursers please him less and less,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ashamed of easy fight, and cheap success.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">The distant cries come driving in the wind&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drowned;</div>
  <div class="i0">A jarring mixture, and a boding sound.</div>
  <div class="i0">"Alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries?</div>

  <div class="i1">Both armies from their bloody work desist,</div>

  <div class="i0">The Trojan hero, who received from fame</div>
  <div class="i0">The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,</div>
  <div class="i0">Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls:</div>
  <div class="i0">Greedy of war where greater glory calls,</div>

  <div class="i1">The nations, overawed, surcease the fight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Immoveable their bodies, fixed their sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Even death stands still; nor from above they throw</div>
  <div class="i0">Their darts, nor drive their battering-rams below.</div>
  <div class="i0">In silent order either army stands,</div>
  <div class="i0">And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Ausonian king beholds, with wondering sight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Two mighty champions matched in single fight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,</div>
  <div class="i0">With swords to try their titles to the state.</div>
  <div class="i1">Now, in closed field, each other from afar</div>
  <div class="i0">They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.</div>
  <div class="i0">They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet,</div>
  <div class="i0">The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,</div>
  <div class="i0">And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.</div>
  <div class="i0">Courage conspires with chance; and both engage</div>
  <div class="i0">With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.</div>
  <div class="i1">As, when two bulls for their fair female fight</div>
  <div class="i0">In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height,</div>
  <div class="i0">With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;</div>
  <div class="i0">Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wait the event&mdash;which victor they shall bear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:</div>
  <div class="i0">With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,</div>
  <div class="i0">And push for push, and wound for wound, return;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their dewlaps gored, their sides are laved in blood;</div>
  <div class="i0">Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow through the wood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Such was the combat in the listed ground;</div>
  <div class="i0">So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.</div>

  <div class="i0">On this side, life, and lucky chance ascends;</div>
  <div class="i0">Loaded with death, that other scale descends.</div>
  <div class="i0">Raised on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow</div>
  <div class="i0">Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:</div>
  <div class="i0">Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side,</div>
  <div class="i0">As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.</div>
  <div class="i0">But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.</div>
  <div class="i0">Now 'tis but death or flight: disarmed he flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he joined,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hurrying to war, disordered in his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Snatched the first weapon which his haste could find.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas not the fated sword his father bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.</div>
  <div class="i0">This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held:</div>
  <div class="i0">But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,</div>
  <div class="i0">The mortal-tempered steel deceived his hand:</div>
  <div class="i0">The shivered fragments shone amid the sand.</div>
  <div class="i1">Surprised with fear, he fled along the field,</div>
  <div class="i0">And now forthright, and now in orbits wheeled:</div>
  <div class="i0">For here the Trojan troops the list surround,</div>
  <div class="i0">And there the pass is closed with pools and marshy ground.</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas hastens, though with heavier pace&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus, when a fearful stag is closed around</div>
  <div class="i0">With crimson toils, or in a river found,</div>
  <div class="i0">High on the bank the deep-mouthed hound appears,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;</div>
  <div class="i0">The persecuted creature, to and fro,</div>
  <div class="i0">Turns here and there, to 'scape his Umbrian foe:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Steep is the ascent, and, if he gains the land,</div>
  <div class="i0">The purple death is pitched along the strand:</div>
  <div class="i0">His eager foe, determined to the chase,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stretched at his length, gains ground at every pace:</div>
  <div class="i0">Now to his beamy head he makes his way,</div>
  <div class="i0">And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:</div>
  <div class="i0">Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;</div>
  <div class="i0">He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:</div>
  <div class="i0">The rocks, the lakes, the meadows, ring with cries;</div>
  <div class="i0">The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.</div>
  <div class="i1">Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames</div>
  <div class="i0">His tardy troops, and calling by their names,</div>
  <div class="i0">Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats</div>
  <div class="i0">The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats</div>
  <div class="i0">To lay in ashes, if they dare supply,</div>
  <div class="i0">With arms or aid, his vanquished enemy;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,</div>
  <div class="i0">With vigour, though diminished of his force.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ten times already, round the listed place,</div>
  <div class="i0">One chief had fled, and t'other given the chase:</div>
  <div class="i0">No trivial prize is played; for on the life</div>
  <div class="i0">Or death of Turnus, now depends the strife.</div>

  <div class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Within the space, an olive-tree had stood,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

  <div class="i0">With heedless hands the Trojans felled the tree,</div>
  <div class="i0">To make the ground inclosed for combat free.</div>
  <div class="i0">Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then stooped, and tugged with force immense, to free</div>
  <div class="i0">The encumbered spear from the tenacious tree;</div>
  <div class="i0">That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">His flying weapon might from far attain.</div>

  <div class="i1">Confused with fear, bereft of human aid,</div>

  <div class="i0">"O Faunus! pity! and thou, mother Earth,</div>

  <div class="i0">Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand</div>

  <div class="i0">Nor with successless vows invoked their aid.</div>
  <div class="i0">The incumbent hero wrenched, and pulled, and strained;</div>
  <div class="i0">But still the stubborn earth the steel detained.</div>
  <div class="i0">Juturna took her time; and, while in vain</div>
  <div class="i0">He strove, assumed Metiscus' form again,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, in that imitated shape, restored</div>
  <div class="i0">To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.</div>
  <div class="i0">The queen of love&mdash;who, with disdain and grief,</div>
  <div class="i0">Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief&mdash;</div>

  <div class="i0">And as, when heavy sleep has closed the sight,</div>

<p>Amata, ever partial to the cause of Turnus, had just before desired
him, with all manner of earnestness, not to engage his rival
in single fight; which was his present resolution. Virgil, though
(in favour of his hero) he never tells us directly that Lavinia preferred
Turnus to Æneas, yet has insinuated this preference twice
before. For mark, in the seventh Æneïd, she left her father, (who
had promised her to Æneas without asking her consent,) and followed
her mother into the woods, with a troop of Bacchanals,
where Amata sung the marriage-song, in the name of Turnus;
which, if she had disliked, she might have opposed. Then, in the
eleventh Æneïd, when her mother went to the temple of Pallas,
to invoke her aid against Æneas, whom she calls by no better name
than <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Phrygius prædo</i>, Lavinia sits by her in the same chair or litter,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">juxtaque comes Lavinia virgo,&mdash;oculos dejecta decoros</i>. What
greater sign of love, than fear and concernment for the lover? In
the lines which I have quoted, she not only sheds tears, but
changes colour. She had been bred up with Turnus; and Æneas
was wholly a stranger to her. Turnus, in probability, was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
first love, and favoured by her mother, who had the ascendant
over her father. But I am much deceived, if (besides what I
have said) there be not a secret satire against the sex, which is
lurking under this description of Virgil, who seldom speaks well
of women&mdash;better indeed of Camilla, than any other&mdash;for he commends
her beauty and valour&mdash;because he would concern the reader
for her death. But valour is no very proper praise for woman-kind;
and beauty is common to the sex. He says also somewhat
of Andromache, but transiently: and his Venus is a better mother
than a wife; for she owns to Vulcan she had a son by another
man. The rest are Junos, Dianas, Didos, Amatas, two
mad prophetesses, three Harpies on earth, and as many Furies
under ground. This fable of Lavinia includes a secret moral;
that women, in their choice of husbands, prefer the younger of
their suitors to the elder; are insensible of merit, fond of handsomeness,
and, generally speaking, rather hurried away by their
appetite, than governed by their reason.</p>

  <div class="i0"><i>The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_166">166.</a></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet had said, in the preceding lines, that Mnestheus, Serestus,
and Asylas, led on the Trojans, the Tuscans, and the Arcadians:
but none of the printed copies, which I have seen, mention
any leader of the Rutulians and Latins, but Messapus the son
of Neptune. Ruæus takes notice of this passage, and seems to
wonder at it; but gives no reason, why Messapus is alone without
a coadjutor.</p>

<p>The four verses of Virgil run thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Totæ adeo conversæ acies, omnesque Latini,</i></div>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et Messapus equûm domitor, et fortis Asylas,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tuscorumque phalanx, Evandrique Arcades alæ.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I doubt not but the third line was originally thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et Messapus equûm domitor, et fortis Atinas:</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>for the two names of Asylas and Atinas are so like, that one might
easily be mistaken for the other by the transcribers. And to fortify
this opinion, we find afterward, in the relation of Saces to
Turnus, that Atinas is joined with Messapus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Soli, pro portis, Messapus et acer Atinas</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sustentant aciem</i>&mdash;&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In general I observe, not only in this Æneïd, but in all the six
last Books, that Æneas is never seen on horseback, and but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
before, as I remember, in the fourth, where he hunts with Dido.
The reason of this, if I guess aright, was a secret compliment
which the poet made to his countrymen the Romans, the strength
of whose armies consisted most in foot, which, I think, were all
Romans and Italians. But their wings or squadrons were made
up of their allies, who were foreigners.</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words in the original are these:</p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pro Latio obtestor, pro majestate tuorum</i>.</p>

<p>Virgil very artfully uses here the word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">majestas</i>, which the Romans
loved so well, that they appropriated it to themselves&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Majestas
populi Romani</i>. This title, applied to kings, is very modern;
and that is all I will say of it at present, though the word requires
a larger note. In the word <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tuorum</i>, is included the sense of my
translation, <em>Your father's land</em>, because Saturn, the father of
Jove, had governed that part of Italy, after his expulsion from
Crete. But that on which I most insist, is the address of the poet,
in this speech of Juno. Virgil was sufficiently sensible, as I have
said in the preface, that whatever the common opinion was, concerning
the descent of the Romans from the Trojans, yet the ancient
customs, rites, laws, and habits of those Trojans were
wholly lost, and perhaps also that they had never been: and, for
this reason, he introduces Juno in this place, requesting of Jupiter
that no memory might remain of Troy (the town she hated), that
the people hereafter should not be called Trojans, nor retain any
thing which belonged to their predecessors. And why might not
this also be concerted betwixt our author and his friend Horace,
to hinder Augustus from re-building Troy, and removing thither
the seat of empire, a design so unpleasing to the Romans? But of
this I am not positive, because I have not consulted Dacier, and
the rest of the critics, to ascertain the time in which Horace writ
the ode relating to that subject.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The father of these (not here mentioned) was Acheron: the
names of the three were Alecto, Megæra, and Tisiphone. They
were called Furies in hell, on earth Harpies, and in heaven Diræ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Two of these assisted at the throne of Jupiter, and were employed
by him to punish the wickedness of mankind. These two must be
Megæra and Tisiphone&mdash;not Alecto; for Juno expressly commands
her to return to hell, from whence she came; and gives
this reason:</p>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cede locis</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Probably this Dira, unnamed by the poet in this place, might
be Tisiphone; for, though we find her in hell, in the Sixth Æneïd,
employed in the punishment of the damned,</p>

<div class="container">

<p>yet afterwards she is on earth in the tenth Æneïd, and amidst the
battle,</p>

<div class="container">

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pallida Tisiphone media inter millia sævit</i>&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which I guess to be Tisiphone, the rather, by the etymology of
her name, which is compounded of τιω ulciscor, and φονος coedes;
part of her errand being to affright Turnus with the stings of a
guilty conscience, and denounce vengeance against him for breaking
the first treaty, by refusing to yield Lavinia to Æneas, to whom
she was promised by her father&mdash;and, consequently, for being
the author of an unjust war; and also for violating the second
treaty, by declining the single combat, which he had stipulated
with his rival, and called the gods to witness before their altars.
As for the names of the Harpies, (so called on earth,) Hesiod tells
us they were Iris, Aëllo, and Ocypete. Virgil calls one of them
Celæno: this, I doubt not, was Alecto, whom Virgil calls, in the
Third Æneïd, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Furiarum maxima</i>, and in the sixth again by the
same name&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Furiarum maxima juxta accubat</i>. That she was the
chief of the Furies, appears by her description in the Seventh
Æneïd; to which, for haste, I refer the reader.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="first drop">W</span><span class="smcap">hat</span> Virgil wrote in the vigour of his age, in
plenty and at ease, I have undertaken to translate
in my declining years; struggling with wants, oppressed
with sickness, curbed in my genius, liable
to be misconstrued in all I write; and my judges,
if they are not very equitable, already prejudiced
against me, by the lying character which has been
given them of my morals. Yet, steady to my principles,
and not dispirited with my afflictions, I have,
by the blessing of God on my endeavours, overcome
all difficulties, and, in some measure, acquitted
myself of the debt which I owed the public
when I undertook this work. In the first place,
therefore, I thankfully acknowledge to the Almighty
Power the assistance he has given me in the beginning,
the prosecution, and conclusion, of my present
studies, which are more happily performed
than I could have promised to myself, when I laboured
under such discouragements. For, what I
have done, imperfect as it is for want of health and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
leisure to correct it, will be judged in after-ages,
and possibly in the present, to be no dishonour to my
native country, whose language and poetry would
be more esteemed abroad, if they were better understood.
Somewhat (give me leave to say) I have
added to both of them in the choice of words, and
harmony of numbers, which were wanting (especially
the last) in all our poets, even in those who,
being endued with genius, yet have not cultivated
their mother-tongue with sufficient care; or, relying
on the beauty of their thoughts, have judged the
ornament of words, and sweetness of sound, unnecessary.
One is for raking in Chaucer (our English
Ennius) for antiquated words, which are never
to be revived, but when sound or significancy is
wanting in the present language. But many of his
deserve not this redemption, any more than the
crowds of men who daily die, or are slain for sixpence
in a battle, merit to be restored to life, if a
wish could revive them. Others have no ear for
verse, nor choice of words, nor distinction of
thoughts; but mingle farthings with their gold, to
make up the sum. Here is a field of satire opened
to me: but, since the Revolution, I have wholly renounced
that talent: for who would give physic to
the great, when he is uncalled&mdash;to do his patient
no good, and endanger himself for his prescription?
Neither am I ignorant, but I may justly be condemned
for many of those faults, of which I have
too liberally arraigned others.</p>

<p>It is enough for me, if the government will let
me pass unquestioned. In the mean time, I am
obliged, in gratitude, to return my thanks to many
of them, who have not only distinguished me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
others of the same party, by a particular exception of grace, but,
without considering the man, have been bountiful to the poet&mdash;have
encouraged Virgil to speak such English as I could teach him, and
rewarded his interpreter for the pains he has taken in bringing him over
into Britain, by defraying the charges of his voyage. Even Cerberus, when
he had received the sop, permitted Æneas to pass freely to Elysium. Had
it been offered me, and I had refused it, yet still some gratitude is
due to such who were willing to oblige me: but how much more to those
from whom I have received the favours which they have offered to one of
a different persuasion! amongst whom I cannot omit naming the
Earls of Derby<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and of Peterborough<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. To the first
of these I have not the honour to be known; and
therefore his liberality was as much unexpected, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
it was undeserved. The present Earl of Peterborough
has been pleased long since to accept the tenders
of my service: his favours are so frequent to
me, that I receive them almost by prescription.
No difference of interests or opinion has been able
to withdraw his protection from me. And I might
justly be condemned for the most unthankful of
mankind, if I did not always preserve for him a
most profound respect and inviolable gratitude. I
must also add, that, if the last Æneïd shine amongst
its fellows, it is owing to the commands of Sir William
Trumball,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> one of the principal secretaries of
state, who recommended it, as his favourite, to my
care; and, for his sake particularly, I have made it
mine: for who would confess weariness, when he
enjoined a fresh labour? I could not but invoke the
assistance of a Muse, for this last office.</p>

<p>Neither am I to forget the noble present which
was made me by Gilbert Dolben, Esq. the worthy
son of the late Archbishop of York,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
began this work, enriched me with all the several
editions of Virgil, and all the commentaries of those
editions in Latin; amongst which, I could not
but prefer the Dauphin's, as the last, the shortest,
and the most judicious. Fabrini<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I had also sent
me from Italy; but either he understands Virgil
very imperfectly, or I have no knowledge of my
author.</p>

<p>Being invited by that worthy gentleman, Sir William
Bowyer, to Denham Court, I translated the
First Georgic at his house, and the greatest part of
the last Æneïd.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> A more friendly entertainment no
man ever found. No wonder, therefore, if both
those versions surpass the rest, and own the satisfaction
I received in his converse, with whom I had
the honour to be bred in Cambridge, and in the
same college. The Seventh Æneïd was made English
at Burleigh, the magnificent abode of the Earl
of Exeter.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In a village belonging to his family I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was born;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and under his roof I endeavoured to
make that Æneïd appear in English with as much
lustre as I could; though my author has not given
the finishing strokes either to it, or to the eleventh,
as I perhaps could prove in both, if I durst presume
to criticise my master.</p>

<p>By a letter from William Walsh, of Abberley, Esq.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
(who has so long honoured me with his friendship,
and who, without flattery, is the best critic of our
nation,) I have been informed, that his grace the
Duke of Shrewsbury<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has procured a printed copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of the Pastorals, Georgics, and six first Æneïds, from
my bookseller, and has read them in the country,
together with my friend. This noble person having
been pleased to give them a commendation, which
I presume not to insert, has made me vain enough
to boast of so great a favour, and to think I have
succeeded beyond my hopes; the character of his
excellent judgment, the acuteness of his wit, and
his general knowledge of good letters, being known
as well to all the world, as the sweetness of his disposition,
his humanity, his easiness of access, and
desire of obliging those who stand in need of his
protection, are known to all who have approached
him, and to me in particular, who have formerly
had the honour of his conversation. Whoever has
given the world the translation of part of the Third
Georgic, which he calls "The Power of Love," has
put me to sufficient pains to make my own not inferior
to his;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> as my Lord Roscommon's "Silenus"
had formerly given me the same trouble. The most
ingenious Mr Addison of Oxford has also been as
troublesome to me as the other two, and on the
same account. After his "Bees," my latter swarm is
scarcely worth the hiving.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr Cowley's "Praise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
a Country Life" is excellent, but is rather an imitation
of Virgil, than a version. That I have recovered,
in some measure, the health which I had lost
by too much application to this work, is owing,
next to God's mercy, to the skill and care of Dr
Guibbons<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Dr Hobbs,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the two ornaments of
their profession, whom I can only pay by this acknowledgment.
The whole faculty has always been
ready to oblige me; and the only one of them,
who endeavoured to defame me, had it not in his
power.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I desire pardon from my readers for saying
so much in relation to myself, which concerns
not them; and, with my acknowledgments to all
my subscribers, have only to add, that the few Notes
which follow, are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">par manière d'acquit</i>, because I
had obliged myself by articles to do somewhat of

guesses at my author's meaning in some passages,
than proofs that so he meant. The unlearned
may have recourse to any poetical dictionary in
English, for the names of persons, places, or fables,
which the learned need not: but that little which I
say, is either new or necessary; and the first of
these qualifications never fails to invite a reader, if
not to please him.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>In this last division of poetry, those poems are placed which
have been ascribed to Dryden upon grounds more or less satisfactory,
yet do not seem entitled to be classed with his acknowledged
writings. To some of them he doubtless lent his assistance,
either from friendship to the author, or to the cause in
which they were written. But, even in these, the hand of
Dryden is not so effectually distinguished from that of the inferior
artist, as to entitle them to be removed from the apocryphal
station which is here assigned. Others I would have discarded
altogether, but from the consideration that they were
not of great length, and that the first complete edition of Dryden

<h2><a name="AN_ESSAY_UPON_SATIRE" id="AN_ESSAY_UPON_SATIRE"></a>AN ESSAY UPON SATIRE.</h2>


<p>Among the pieces fathered upon Dryden, without satisfactory
reason, this contains as little internal evidence as any of having received
even the touches of that great master. Yet, as is mentioned
in the Life of our poet, the suspicion of being the author subjected
him to the cowardly revenge of Rochester, who hired bravoes to
beat Dryden, in return for the severity with which he is here
treated. The versification is so harsh, and the satire so coarse and
clumsy, that I can hardly consent to think that Dryden did more
than revise and correct it. If he added a few lines here and there,
he had so industriously levelled them with the rest of the performance,
that they cannot be distinguished from it. The real
author was Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave, afterwards Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>Like other lampoons of the time, the "Essay on Satire" was
handed about in manuscript copies, about November 1679. It is
inserted in the quarto edition of Sheffield Duke of Buckingham's
Works, with many alterations and improvements by Pope, to
whose correction it had been subjected by the noble poet. It
is obvious, and has been well argued by Mr Malone, that if Dryden
had taken any considerable pains with the original copy, Pope
would have had but little to do.</p>

<p>Sheffield, in his "Essay on Poetry," pays our author a very
supercilious and aristocratic compliment on this, his own poem,
having been attributed to him, and the castigation which ensued:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Though praised and punished for another's rhimes,</div>
  <div class="i0">His own deserve as much applause <em>sometimes</em>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is thus that noble authors distribute their praise, like their
bounty, duly seasoned with humbling admonition. In the copy
of the Essay, revised by Pope, this impertinent couplet is omitted.</p>

<div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">H</span><span class="smcap">ow</span> dull, and how insensible a beast</div>
  <div class="i0">Is man, who yet would lord it o'er the rest!</div>
  <div class="i0">Philosophers and poets vainly strove</div>
  <div class="i0">In every age the lumpish mass to move;</div>
  <div class="i0">But those were pedants, when compared with these,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who know, not only to instruct, but please.</div>
  <div class="i0">Poets alone found the delightful way,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mysterious morals gently to convey</div>
  <div class="i0">In charming numbers; so that as men grew</div>
  <div class="i0">Pleased with their poems, they grew wiser too.</div>
  <div class="i0">Satire has always shone among the rest;</div>
  <div class="i0">And is the boldest way, if not the best,</div>
  <div class="i0">To tell men freely of their foulest faults,</div>
  <div class="i0">To laugh at their vain deeds, and vainer thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">In satire, too, the wise took different ways,</div>
  <div class="i0">To each deserving its peculiar praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some did all folly with just sharpness blame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst others laughed and scorned them into shame.</div>
  <div class="i0">But of these two, the last succeeded best,</div>
  <div class="i0">As men aim rightest when they shoot in jest.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, if we may presume to blame our guides,</div>
  <div class="i0">And censure those, who censure all besides,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">In other things they justly are preferred;</div>
  <div class="i0">In this alone methinks the ancients erred:</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the grossest follies they declaim;</div>
  <div class="i0">Hard they pursue, but hunt ignoble game.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nothing is easier than such blots to hit,</div>
  <div class="i0">And 'tis the talent of each vulgar wit:</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, 'tis labour lost; for, who would preach</div>
  <div class="i0">Morals to Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or dull Aston<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> teach?</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis being devout at play, wise at a ball,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or bringing wit and friendship to Whitehall.</div>
  <div class="i0">But with sharp eyes those nicer faults to find,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which lie obscurely in the wisest mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">That little speck which all the rest does spoil,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">To wash off that would be a noble toil;</div>
  <div class="i0">Beyond the loose-writ libels of this age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or the forced scenes of our declining stage;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Above all censure too, each little wit</div>
  <div class="i0">Will be so glad to see the greater hit;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who judging better, though concerned the most,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of such correction will have cause to boast.</div>
  <div class="i0">In such a satire all would seek a share,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every fool will fancy he is there.</div>
  <div class="i0">Old story-tellers, too, must pine and die,</div>
  <div class="i0">To see their antiquated wit laid by;</div>
  <div class="i0">Like her, who missed her name in a lampoon,</div>
  <div class="i0">And grieved to find herself decayed so soon.</div>
  <div class="i0">No common coxcomb must be mentioned here;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not the dull train of dancing sparks appear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor fluttering officers, who never fight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of such a wretched rabble, who would write?</div>
  <div class="i0">Much less half-wits; that's more against our rules;</div>
  <div class="i0">For they are fops, the other are but fools.</div>
  <div class="i0">Who would not be as silly as Dunbar?<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">As dull as Monmouth,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> rather than Sir Carr?<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">The cunning courtier should be slighted too,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who with dull knavery makes so much ado;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till the shrewd fool, by thriving too too fast,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like Æsop's fox, becomes a prey at last.</div>

  <div class="i0">Too ugly, or too easy to be blamed;</div>
  <div class="i0">With whom each rhyming fool keeps such a pother,</div>

  <div class="i0">He turns himself the best to ridicule.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit,</div>

<p>The extremity of license in manners, necessarily leads to equal
license in personal satire; and there never was an age in which
both were carried to such excess as in that of Charles II. These
personal and scandalous libels acquired the name of lampoons,
from the established burden formerly sung to them:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Lampone, lampone, camerada lampone</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dryden suffered under these violent and invisible assaults, as
much as any one of his age; to which his own words, in several
places of his writings, and also the existence of many of the pasquils
themselves in the Luttrel Collection, bear ample witness.
In many of his prologues and epilogues he alludes to this rage for
personal satire, and to the employment which it found for the
half and three quarter wits and courtiers of the time:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Yet these are pearls to your lampooning rhymes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ye abuse yourselves more dully than the times.</div>
  <div class="i0">Scandal, the glory of the English nation,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is worn to rags, and scribbled out of fashion:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Such harmless thrusts, as if, like fencers wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">They had agreed their play before their prize.</div>
  <div class="i0">Faith they may hang their harp upon the willows;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis just like children when they box with pillows.</div>
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 15em;"><em>See</em> Vol. X. p. 365.</span></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Upon the general practice of writing lampoons, and the necessity
of finding some mode of dispersing them, which should diffuse
the scandal widely, while the authors remained concealed,
was founded the self-erected office of Julian, secretary, as he
called himself, to the Muses. This person attended Will's, the
Wits Coffeehouse, as it was called; and dispersed, among the
crowds who frequented that place of gay resort, copies of the lampoons
which had been privately communicated to him by their
authors. "He is described," says Mr Malone, "as a very drunken
fellow, and at one time was confined for a libel." Several
satires were written, in the form of addresses, to him, as well as
the following. There is one among the State Poems, beginning,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Julian, in verse, to ease thy wants I write,</div>
  <div class="i0">Not moved by envy, malice, or by spite,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or pleased with the empty names of wit and sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">But merely to supply thy want of pence:</div>
  <div class="i0">This did inspire my muse, when, out at eel,</div>
  <div class="i0">She saw her needy secretary reel.</div>
  <div class="i0">Grieved that a man, so useful to the age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Should foot it in so mean an equipage;</div>
  <div class="i0">A crying scandal, that the fees of sense</div>
  <div class="i0">Should not be able to support the expence</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a poor scribe, who never thought of wants</div>
  <div class="i0">When able to procure a cup of Nantz.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another, called, "A Consoling Epistle to Julian," is said to have
been written by the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>From a passage in one of the "Letters from the Dead to the Living,"
we learn, that, after Julian's death, and the madness of his
successor, called Summerton, lampoon felt a sensible decay; and
there was no more that "brisk spirit of verse, that used to watch
the follies and vices of the men and women of figure, that they
could not start new ones faster than lampoons exposed them."</p>

<p>In another epistle of the same collection, supposed to be written
by Julian from the shades, to Will Pierre, a low comedian, he
is made thus to boast of the extent of the dominion which he exercised
when on earth.</p>

<p>"The conscious Tub Tavern can witness, and my Berry Street
apartment testify, the solicitations I have had, for the first copy of
a new lampoon, from the greatest lords of the court, though their
own folly and their wives' vices were the subjects. My person
was so sacred, that the terrible scan-man had no terrors for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
whose business was so public and so useful, as conveying about
the faults of the great and the fair; for in my books, the lord was
shewn a knave or fool, though his power defended the former,
and his pride would not see the latter. The antiquated coquet
was told of her age and ugliness, though her vanity placed her
in the first row in the king's box at the playhouse; and in the
view of the congregation at St James's church. The precise
countess, that would be scandalized at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">double entendre</i>, was shown
betwixt a pair of sheets with a well-made footman, in spite of her
quality and conjugal vow. The formal statesman, that set up for
wisdom and honesty, was exposed as a dull tool, and yet a knave,
losing at play his own revenue, and the bribes incident to his post,
besides enjoying the infamy of a poor and fruitless knavery without
any concern. The demure lady, that would scarce sip off the
glass in company, was shewn carousing her bottles in private, of
cool Nantz too, sometimes, to correct the crudities of her last night's
debauch. In short, in my books were seen men and women as
they were, not as they would seem,&mdash;stript of their hypocrisy,
spoiled of the fig-leaves of their quality. A knave was called a
knave, a fool a fool, a jilt a jilt, and a whore a whore. And
the love of scandal and native malice, that men and women have
to one another, made me in such request when alive, that I was
admitted to the lord's closet, when a man of letters and merit
would be thrust out of doors. And I was as familiar with the
ladies as their lap-dogs: for to them I did often good services;
under pretence of a lampoon, I conveyed a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billet doux</i>; and so,
whilst I exposed their vast vices in the present, I prompted matter
for the next lampoon."</p>

<p>The following lampoon, in which it is highly improbable that
Dryden had any share, is chiefly levelled against Sir Car Scrope,
son of Sir Adrian Scrope of Cockington, in Lincolnshire, a
courtier of considerable poetical talents, of whom Anthony
Wood says, "that, as divers satirical copies of verses were made
upon him by other persons, so he hath diverse made by himself
upon them, which are handed about to this day." We have seen
that he is mentioned with contempt in the "Essay on Satire;" and,
in the "Advice to Apollo," in the State Poems, Vol. I. his studies
are thus commemorated:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;Sir Car, that knight of withered face,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, for the reversion of a poet's place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Waits on Melpomene, and sooths her grace;</div>
  <div class="i0">That angry miss alone he strives to please,</div>
  <div class="i0">For fear the rest should teach him wit and ease,</div>
  <div class="i0">And make him quit his loved laborious walks,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where, sad or silent, o'er the room he stalks,</div>
  <div class="i0">And strives to write as wisely as he talks.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>He is also mentioned in many other libels of the day, and some
of his answers are still extant. Rochester assailed him in his
"Allusion to the Tenth Satire of Horace's first Book." Sir Car
Scrope replied, and published a poem in Defence of Satire, to
which the earl retorted by a very coarse set of verses, addressed
to the knight by name. Sir Car Scrope was a tolerable translator
from the classics; and his version of the "Epistle from Sappho
to Phaon" is inserted in the translation of Ovid's Epistles
by several hands, edited by our author. Dryden mentions, in one
of his prefaces, Sir Car Scrope's efforts with approbation. But
it is not from this circumstance alone I conclude that this epistle
has been erroneously attributed to our author; for the whole internal
evidence speaks loudly against its authenticity. Indeed, it
only rests on Dryden's name being placed to it in the 6th volume
of the Miscellanies published after his death.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />


<p>This piece was inserted among Dryden's Works, upon authority
of the following advertisement by his publisher Jacob
Tonson.</p>

<p>"This translation of Monsieur Boileau's 'Art of Poetry' was
made in the year 1680, by Sir William Soame of Suffolk, Baronet;
who, being very intimately acquainted with Mr Dryden, desired
his revisal of it. I saw the manuscript lie in Mr Dryden's
hands for above six months, who made very considerable alterations
in it, particularly the beginning of the Fourth Canto; and it
being his opinion, that it would be better to apply the poem to
English writers, than keep to the French names, as it was first
translated, Sir William desired he would take the pains to make
that alteration; and accordingly that was entirely done by Mr
Dryden.</p>

<p>"The poem was first published in the year 1683. Sir William
was after sent ambassador to Constantinople, in the reign of King
James, but died in the voyage."&mdash;J.T.</p>

<p>To give weight to Tonson's authority, it may be added, that
great part of the poem bears marks of Dryden's polishing hand;
and that some entire passages show at once his taste in criticism,
principles, and prejudices.</p>

  <div class="i0">All that is needless carefully avoid;</div>
  <div class="i0">The mind once satisfied is quickly cloyed:</div>
  <div class="i0">He cannot write, who knows not to give o'er;</div>
  <div class="i0">To mend one fault, he makes a hundred more:</div>
  <div class="i0">A verse was weak, you turn it much too strong,</div>
  <div class="i0">And grow obscure for fear you should be long.</div>
  <div class="i0">Some are not gaudy, but are flat and dry;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not to be low, another soars too high.</div>
  <div class="i0">Would you of every one deserve the praise?</div>
  <div class="i0">In writing vary your discourse and phrase;</div>
  <div class="i0">A frozen style, that neither ebbs nor flows,</div>
  <div class="i0">Instead of pleasing, makes us gape and dose.</div>
  <div class="i0">Those tedious authors are esteemed by none</div>
  <div class="i0">Who tire us, humming the same heavy tone.</div>
  <div class="i0">Happy who in his verse can gently steer,</div>
  <div class="i0">From grave to light; from pleasant to severe:</div>
  <div class="i0">His works will be admired wherever found,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oft with buyers will be compassed round.</div>
  <div class="i0">In all you write, be neither low nor vile;</div>
  <div class="i0">The meanest theme may have a proper style.</div>
  <div class="i1">The dull burlesque appeared with impudence,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pleased by novelty in spite of sense.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">All, except trivial points, grew out of date;</div>
  <div class="i0">Parnassus spoke the cant of Billingsgate;</div>
  <div class="i0">Boundless and mad, disordered rhyme was seen;</div>
  <div class="i0">Disguised Apollo changed to Harlequin.</div>
  <div class="i0">This plague, which first in country towns began,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cities and kingdoms quickly over-ran;</div>
  <div class="i0">The dullest scribblers some admirers found,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the "Mock Tempest"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was a while renowned.</div>
  <div class="i0">But this low stuff the town at last despised,</div>
  <div class="i0">And scorned the folly that they once had prized;</div>
  <div class="i0">Distinguished dull from natural and plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And left the villages to Flecknoe's reign.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let not so mean a style your muse debase,</div>
  <div class="i0">But learn from Butler the buffooning grace;</div>
  <div class="i0">And let burlesque in ballads be employed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet noisy bombast carefully avoid;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor think to raise, though on Pharsalia's plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">"Millions of mourning mountains of the slain:"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></div>

  <div class="i0">Chuse a just style; be grave without constraint,</div>
  <div class="i0">Great without pride, and lovely without paint:</div>
  <div class="i0">Write what your reader may be pleased to hear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And for the measure have a careful ear.</div>
  <div class="i0">On easy numbers fix your happy choice;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of jarring sounds avoid the odious noise:</div>
  <div class="i0">The fullest verse, and the most laboured sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Displease us, if the ear once take offence.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our ancient verse, as homely as the times,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was rude, unmeasured, only tagged with rhymes;</div>
  <div class="i0">Number and cadence, that have since been shown,</div>
  <div class="i0">To those unpolished writers were unknown.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fairfax<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> was he, who, in that darker age,</div>
  <div class="i0">By his just rules restrained poetic rage;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>

  <div class="i0">And taught the noble art of writing well;</div>
  <div class="i0">To stricter rules the stanza did restrain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And found for poetry a richer vein.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then D'Avenant<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> came, who, with a new-found art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Changed all, spoiled all, and had his way apart;</div>
  <div class="i0">His haughty muse all others did despise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And thought in triumph to bear off the prize,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Till the sharp-sighted critics of the times,</div>
  <div class="i0">In their Mock-Gondibert, exposed his rhymes;</div>
  <div class="i0">The laurels he pretended did refuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">And dashed the hopes of his aspiring muse.</div>
  <div class="i0">This headstrong writer falling from on high,</div>
  <div class="i0">Made following authors take less liberty.</div>
  <div class="i0">Waller came last, but was the first whose art</div>
  <div class="i0">Just weight and measure did to verse impart;</div>
  <div class="i0">That of a well-placed word could teach the force,</div>
  <div class="i0">And shewed for poetry a nobler course;</div>
  <div class="i0">His happy genius did our tongue refine,</div>
  <div class="i0">And easy words with pleasing numbers join;</div>
  <div class="i0">His verses to good method did apply,</div>
  <div class="i0">And changed hard discord to soft harmony.</div>
  <div class="i0">All owned his laws; which, long approved and tried,</div>
  <div class="i0">To present authors now may be a guide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tread boldly in his steps, secure from fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And be, like him, in your expressions clear.</div>
  <div class="i0">If in your verse you drag, and sense delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">My patience tires, my fancy goes astray;</div>
  <div class="i0">And from your vain discourse I turn my mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor search an author troublesome to find.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">There is a kind of writer pleased with sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose fustian head with clouds is compassed round,</div>
  <div class="i0">No reason can disperse them with its light:</div>
  <div class="i0">Learn then to think ere you pretend to write.</div>
  <div class="i0">As your idea's clear, or else obscure,</div>
  <div class="i0">The expression follows perfect or impure:</div>
  <div class="i0">What we conceive with ease we can express;</div>
  <div class="i0">Words to the notions flow with readiness.</div>
  <div class="i1">Observe the language well in all you write,</div>
  <div class="i0">And swerve not from it in your loftiest flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">The smoothest verse, and the exactest sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Displease us, if ill English give offence:</div>
  <div class="i0">A barbarous phrase no reader can approve;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor bombast, noise, or affectation love.</div>
  <div class="i0">In short, without pure language, what you write</div>
  <div class="i0">Can never yield us profit or delight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Take time for thinking; never work in haste;</div>
  <div class="i0">And value not yourself for writing fast.</div>
  <div class="i0">A rapid poem, with such fury writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shews want of judgment, not abounding wit.</div>
  <div class="i0">More pleased we are to see a river lead</div>
  <div class="i0">His gentle streams along a flowery mead,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than from high banks to hear loud torrents roar,</div>
  <div class="i0">With foamy waters on a muddy shore.</div>
  <div class="i0">Gently make haste,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of labour not afraid;</div>
  <div class="i0">A hundred times consider what you've said:</div>
  <div class="i0">Polish, repolish, every colour lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sometimes add, but oftener take away.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not enough, when swarming faults are writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">That here and there are scattered sparks of wit:</div>
  <div class="i0">Each object must be fixed in the due place,</div>
  <div class="i0">And differing parts have corresponding grace;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till, by a curious art disposed, we find</div>
  <div class="i0">One perfect whole, of all the pieces joined.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Keep to your subject close in all you say;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor for a sounding sentence ever stray.</div>
  <div class="i0">The public censure for your writings fear,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to yourself be critic most severe.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fantastic wits their darling follies love;</div>
  <div class="i0">But find you faithful friends that will reprove,</div>
  <div class="i0">That on your works may look with careful eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of your faults be zealous enemies:</div>
  <div class="i0">Lay by an author's pride and vanity,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from a friend a flatterer descry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who seems to like, but means not what he says:</div>
  <div class="i0">Embrace true counsel, but suspect false praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">A sycophant will every thing admire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Each verse, each sentence sets his soul on fire:</div>
  <div class="i0">All is divine! there's not a word amiss!</div>
  <div class="i0">He shakes with joy, and weeps with tenderness;</div>
  <div class="i0">He overpowers you with his mighty praise.</div>
  <div class="i0">Truth never moves in those impetuous ways;</div>
  <div class="i0">A faithful friend is careful of your fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">And freely will your heedless errors blame;</div>
  <div class="i0">He cannot pardon a neglected line,</div>
  <div class="i0">But verse to rule and order will confine;</div>
  <div class="i0">Reprove of words the too-affected sound;&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Here the sense flags, and your expression's round,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your fancy tires, and your discourse grows vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your terms improper; make it just and plain.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus 'tis a faithful friend will freedom use;</div>
  <div class="i0">But authors, partial to their darling muse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Think to protect it they have just pretence,</div>
  <div class="i0">And at your friendly counsel take offence.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Said you of this, that the expression's flat?</div>
  <div class="i0">Your servant, sir, you must excuse me that,</div>
  <div class="i0">He answers you.&mdash;This word has here no grace,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pray leave it out;&mdash;that, sir, 's the properest place.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">This turn I like not;&mdash;'tis approved by all.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus, resolute not from one fault to fall,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Thus, resolute not from one fault to fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">If there's a syllable of which you doubt,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a sure reason not to blot it out.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet still he says you may his faults confute,</div>
  <div class="i0">And over him your power is absolute.</div>
  <div class="i0">But of his feigned humility take heed;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a bait laid to make you hear him read.</div>
  <div class="i0">And when he leaves you happy in his muse,</div>
  <div class="i0">Restless he runs some other to abuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">And often finds; for in our scribbling times</div>
  <div class="i0">No fool can want a sot to praise his rhymes.</div>
  <div class="i0">The flattest work has ever in the court</div>
  <div class="i0">Met with some zealous ass for its support;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in all times a forward scribbling fop</div>
  <div class="i0">Has found some greater fool to cry him up.</div>

<h3>CANTO II.</h3>

<p class="p4">PASTORAL.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">A</span><span class="smcap">s</span> a fair nymph, when rising from her bed,</div>
  <div class="i0">With sparkling diamonds dresses not her head,</div>
  <div class="i0">But without gold, or pearl, or costly scents,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gathers from neighbouring fields her ornaments;</div>
  <div class="i0">Such, lovely in its dress, but plain withal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ought to appear a perfect Pastoral.</div>
  <div class="i0">Its humble method nothing has of fierce,</div>
  <div class="i0">But hates the rattling of a lofty verse;</div>
  <div class="i0">There native beauty pleases, and excites,</div>
  <div class="i0">And never with harsh sounds the ear affrights.</div>
  <div class="i0">But in this style a poet often spent,</div>
  <div class="i0">In rage throws by his rural instrument,</div>
  <div class="i0">And vainly, when disordered thoughts abound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Amidst the Eclogue makes the trumpet sound:</div>
  <div class="i0">Pan flies alarmed into the neighbouring woods,</div>
  <div class="i0">And frighted nymphs dive down into the floods.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Opposed to this, another, low in style,</div>
  <div class="i0">Makes shepherds speak a language base and vile:</div>
  <div class="i0">His writings, flat and heavy, without sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Kissing the earth, and creeping on the ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">You'd swear that Randal, in his rustic strains,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Again was quavering to the country swains,</div>
  <div class="i0">And changing, without care of sound or dress,</div>
  <div class="i0">Strephon and Phyllis, into Tom and Bess.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twixt these extremes 'tis hard to keep the right;</div>
  <div class="i0">For guides take Virgil, and read Theocrite:</div>
  <div class="i0">Be their just writings, by the Gods inspired,</div>
  <div class="i0">Your constant pattern, practised, and admired.</div>
  <div class="i0">By them alone you'll easily comprehend</div>
  <div class="i0">How poets, without shame, may condescend</div>
  <div class="i0">To sing of gardens, fields, of flowers, and fruit,</div>
  <div class="i0">To stir up shepherds, and to tune the flute;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of love's rewards to tell the happy hour,</div>
  <div class="i0">Daphne a tree, Narcissus made a flower,</div>
  <div class="i0">And by what means the Eclogue yet has power</div>
  <div class="i0">To make the woods worthy a conqueror:</div>
  <div class="i0">This of their writings is the grace and flight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their risings lofty, yet not out of sight.</div>

<p class="p4">ELEGY.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The Elegy, that loves a mournful style,</div>
  <div class="i0">With unbound hair weeps at a funeral pile;</div>
  <div class="i0">It paints the lover's torments and delights,</div>
  <div class="i0">A mistress flatters, threatens, and invites:</div>
  <div class="i0">But well these raptures if you'll make us see,</div>
  <div class="i0">You must know love as well as poetry.</div>
  <div class="i0">I hate those lukewarm authors, whose forced fire</div>
  <div class="i0">In a cold style describes a hot desire;</div>
  <div class="i0">That sigh by rule, and, raging in cold blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their sluggish muse whip to an amorous mood:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their feigned transports appear but flat and vain;</div>
  <div class="i0">They always sigh, and always hug their chain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Adore their prison, and their sufferings bless,</div>
  <div class="i0">Make sense and reason quarrel as they please.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Twas not of old in this affected tone,</div>
  <div class="i0">That smooth Tibullus made his amorous moan;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor Ovid, when instructed from above,</div>
  <div class="i0">By nature's rules he taught the art of love.</div>
  <div class="i0">The heart in Elegies forms the discourse.</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The Ode is bolder, and has greater force;</div>
  <div class="i0">Mounting to heaven in her ambitious flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Amongst the Gods and heroes takes delight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of Pisa's wrestlers tells the sinewy force,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sings the dusty conqueror's glorious course;</div>
  <div class="i0">To Simoïs' streams does fierce Achilles bring,</div>
  <div class="i0">And makes the Ganges bow to Britain's king.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes she flies like an industrious bee,</div>
  <div class="i0">And robs the flowers by nature's chemistry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Describes the shepherd's dances, feasts, and bliss,</div>
  <div class="i0">And boasts from Phyllis to surprise a kiss,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">When gently she resists with feigned remorse,</div>
  <div class="i0">That what she grants may seem to be by force:</div>
  <div class="i0">Her generous style at random oft will part,</div>
  <div class="i0">And by a brave disorder shows her art.</div>
  <div class="i0">Unlike those fearful poets, whose cold rhyme</div>
  <div class="i0">In all their raptures keeps exactest time,</div>
  <div class="i0">That sing the illustrious hero's mighty praise</div>
  <div class="i0">(Lean writers!) by the terms of weeks and days;</div>
  <div class="i0">And dare not from least circumstances part,</div>
  <div class="i0">But take all towns by strictest rules of art:</div>
  <div class="i0">Apollo drives those fops from his abode;</div>
  <div class="i0">And some have said that once the humorous god</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolving all such scribblers to confound,</div>
  <div class="i0">For the short Sonnet ordered this strict bound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Set rules for the just measure, and the time,</div>
  <div class="i0">The easy running and alternate rhyme;</div>
  <div class="i0">But above all, those licences denied</div>
  <div class="i0">Which in these writings the lame sense supplied;</div>
  <div class="i0">Forbade an useless line should find a place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or a repeated word appear with grace.</div>
  <div class="i0">A faultless Sonnet, finished thus, would be</div>
  <div class="i0">Worth tedious volumes of loose poetry.</div>
  <div class="i0">A hundred scribbling authors without ground,</div>
  <div class="i0">Believe they have this only ph&oelig;nix found:</div>
  <div class="i0">When yet the exactest scarce have two or three,</div>
  <div class="i0">Among whole tomes from faults and censure free.</div>
  <div class="i0">The rest, but little read, regarded less,</div>
  <div class="i0">Are shovelled to the pastry from the press.</div>
  <div class="i0">Closing the sense within the measured time,</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis hard to fit the reason to the rhyme.</div>

<p class="p4">EPIGRAM.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The Epigram, with little art composed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is one good sentence in a distich closed.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">These points that by Italians first were prized,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our ancient authors knew not, or despised:</div>
  <div class="i0">The vulgar dazzled with their glaring light,</div>
  <div class="i0">To their false pleasures quickly they invite;</div>
  <div class="i0">But public favour so increased their pride,</div>
  <div class="i0">They overwhelmed Parnassus with their tide.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Madrigal at first was overcome,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the proud Sonnet fell by the same doom;</div>
  <div class="i0">With these grave Tragedy adorned her flights,</div>
  <div class="i0">And mournful Elegy her funeral rites:</div>
  <div class="i0">A hero never failed them on the stage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Without his point a lover durst not rage;</div>
  <div class="i0">The amorous shepherds took more care to prove</div>
  <div class="i0">True to his point, than faithful to their love.</div>
  <div class="i0">Each word, like Janus, had a double face;</div>
  <div class="i0">And prose, as well as verse, allowed it place:</div>
  <div class="i0">The lawyer with conceits adorned his speech,</div>
  <div class="i0">The parson without quibbling could not preach.</div>
  <div class="i0">At last affronted reason looked about,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from all serious matters shut them out;</div>
  <div class="i0">Declared that none should use them without shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Except a scattering in the Epigram;</div>
  <div class="i0">Provided that by art, and in due time,</div>
  <div class="i0">They turned upon the thought, and not the rhyme.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus in all parts disorders did abate:</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet quibblers in the court had leave to prate;</div>
  <div class="i0">Insipid jesters, and unpleasant fools,</div>
  <div class="i0">A corporation of dull punning drolls.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not, but that sometimes a dexterous muse</div>
  <div class="i0">May with advantage a turned sense abuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">And on a word may trifle with address;</div>
  <div class="i0">But above all avoid the fond excess,</div>
  <div class="i0">And think not, when your verse and sense are lame,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a dull point to tag your Epigram.</div>
  <div class="i1">Each poem his perfection has apart;</div>
  <div class="i0">The British round in plainness shows his art.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The Ballad, though the pride of ancient time,</div>
  <div class="i0">Has often nothing but his humorous rhyme;</div>
  <div class="i0">The Madrigal may softer passions move,</div>
  <div class="i0">And breathe the tender ecstasies of love.</div>
  <div class="i0">Desire to show itself, and not to wrong,</div>
  <div class="i0">Armed Virtue first with Satire in its tongue.</div>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">Lucilius was the man, who, bravely bold,</div>
  <div class="i0">To Roman vices did this mirror hold,</div>
  <div class="i0">Protected humble goodness from reproach,</div>
  <div class="i0">Showed worth on foot, and rascals in the coach.</div>
  <div class="i0">Horace his pleasing wit to this did add,</div>
  <div class="i0">And none uncensured could be fool or mad:</div>
  <div class="i0">Unhappy was that wretch, whose name might be</div>

  <div class="i0">Persius obscure, but full of sense and wit,</div>
  <div class="i0">Affected brevity in all he writ;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Juvenal, learned as those times could be,</div>
  <div class="i0">Too far did stretch his sharp hyperbole;</div>
  <div class="i0">Though horrid truths through all his labours shine,</div>
  <div class="i0">In what he writes there's something of divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whether he blames the Caprean debauch,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or of Sejanus' fall tells the approach,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or that he makes the trembling senate come</div>
  <div class="i0">To the stern tyrant to receive their doom;</div>
  <div class="i0">Or Roman vice in coarsest habits shews,</div>
  <div class="i0">And paints an empress reeking from the stews:</div>
  <div class="i0">In all he writes appears a noble fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">To follow such a master then desire.</div>
  <div class="i0">Chaucer alone, fixed on this solid base,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his old style conserves a modern grace:</div>
  <div class="i0">Too happy, if the freedom of his rhymes</div>
  <div class="i0">Offended not the method of our times.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The Latin writers decency neglect;</div>
  <div class="i0">But modern authors challenge our respect,</div>
  <div class="i0">And at immodest writings take offence,</div>
  <div class="i0">If clean expression cover not the sense.</div>
  <div class="i0">I love sharp Satire, from obsceneness free;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not impudence, that preaches modesty:</div>
  <div class="i0">Our English, who in malice never fail,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hence in lampoons and libels learn to rail;</div>
  <div class="i0">Pleasant detraction, that by singing goes</div>
  <div class="i0">From mouth to mouth, and as it marches grows:</div>
  <div class="i0">Our freedom in our poetry we see,</div>
  <div class="i0">That child of joy begot by liberty.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, vain blasphemer, tremble when you chuse</div>
  <div class="i0">God for the subject of your impious muse:</div>
  <div class="i0">At last, those jests which libertines invent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bring the lewd author to just punishment.</div>
  <div class="i0">Even in a song there must be art and sense;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet sometimes we have seen that wine, or chance,</div>
  <div class="i0">Have warmed cold brains, and given dull writers mettle,</div>
  <div class="i0">And furnished out a scene for Mr Settle.</div>
  <div class="i0">But for one lucky hit, that made thee please,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let not thy folly grow to a disease,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor think thyself a wit; for in our age</div>
  <div class="i0">If a warm fancy does some fop engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">He neither eats nor sleeps till he has writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">But plagues the world with his adulterate wit.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay 'tis a wonder, if, in his dire rage,</div>
  <div class="i0">He prints not his dull follies for the stage;</div>
  <div class="i0">And in the front of all his senseless plays,</div>
  <div class="i0">Makes David Logan crown his head with bays.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></div>

<h3>CANTO III.</h3>

<p class="p4">TRAGEDY.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">T</span><span class="smcap">here's</span> not a monster bred beneath the sky,</div>
  <div class="i0">But well-disposed by art, may please the eye:</div>
  <div class="i0">A curious workman by his skill divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">From an ill object makes a good design.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus to delight us, Tragedy, in tears</div>
  <div class="i0">For &OElig;dipus, provokes our hopes and fears;</div>
  <div class="i0">For parricide Orestes asks relief,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, to encrease our pleasure, causes grief.</div>
  <div class="i0">You then that in this noble art would rise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Come, and in lofty verse dispute the prize.</div>
  <div class="i0">Would you upon the stage acquire renown,</div>
  <div class="i0">And for your judges summon all the town?</div>
  <div class="i0">Would you your works for ever should remain,</div>
  <div class="i0">And after ages past be sought again?</div>
  <div class="i0">In all you write, observe with care and art</div>
  <div class="i0">To move the passions, and incline the heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">If in a laboured act, the pleasing rage</div>
  <div class="i0">Cannot our hopes and fears by turns engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor in our mind a feeling pity raise,</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain with learned scenes you fill your plays:</div>
  <div class="i0">Your cold discourse can never move the mind</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a stern critic, naturally unkind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, justly tired with your pedantic flight,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or falls asleep, or censures all you write.</div>
  <div class="i0">The secret is, attention first to gain;</div>
  <div class="i0">To move our minds, and then to entertain;</div>
  <div class="i0">That from the very opening of the scenes,</div>
  <div class="i0">The first may show us what the author means.</div>
  <div class="i0">I'm tired to see an actor on the stage,</div>
  <div class="i0">That knows not whether he's to laugh or rage;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Who, an intrigue unravelling in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Instead of pleasing keeps my mind in pain.</div>
  <div class="i0">I'd rather much the nauseous dunce should say</div>
  <div class="i0">Downright, my name is Hector in the play;</div>
  <div class="i0">Than with a mass of miracles, ill-joined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Confound my ears, and not instruct my mind.</div>
  <div class="i0">The subject's never soon enough exprest;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your place of action must be fixed, and rest.</div>
  <div class="i0">A Spanish poet may with good event,</div>
  <div class="i0">In one day's space whole ages represent;</div>
  <div class="i0">There oft the hero of a wandering stage</div>
  <div class="i0">Begins a child, and ends the play of age:</div>
  <div class="i0">But we, that are by reason's rules confined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will, that with art the poem be designed;</div>
  <div class="i0">That unity of action, time, and place,</div>
  <div class="i0">Keep the stage full, and all our labours grace.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">Write not what cannot be with ease conceived;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some truths may be too strong to be believed.</div>
  <div class="i0">A foolish wonder cannot entertain;</div>
  <div class="i0">My mind's not moved if your discourse be vain.</div>
  <div class="i0">You may relate what would offend the eye:</div>
  <div class="i0">Seeing, indeed, would better satisfy;</div>
  <div class="i0">But there are objects that a curious art</div>
  <div class="i0">Hides from the eyes, yet offers to the heart.</div>
  <div class="i0">The mind is most agreeably surprised,</div>
  <div class="i0">When a well-woven subject, long disguised,</div>
  <div class="i0">You on a sudden artfully unfold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And give the whole another face and mould.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">At first the Tragedy was void of art;</div>
  <div class="i0">A song, where each man danced and sung his part,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of God Bacchus roaring out the praise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sought a good vintage for their jolly days:</div>
  <div class="i0">Then wine and joy were seen in each man's eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And a fat goat was the best singer's prize.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thespis was first, who, all besmeared with lee,</div>
  <div class="i0">Began this pleasure for posterity:</div>
  <div class="i0">And with his carted actors, and a song,</div>
  <div class="i0">Amused the people as he passed along.</div>
  <div class="i0">Next Æschylus the different persons placed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with a better mask his players graced:</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon a theatre his verse expressed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And showed his hero with a buskin dressed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Sophocles, the genius of his age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Encreased the pomp and beauty of the stage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Engaged the chorus song in every part,</div>
  <div class="i0">And polished rugged verse by rules of art:</div>
  <div class="i0">He in the Greek did those perfections gain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which the weak Latin never could attain.</div>
  <div class="i0">Our pious fathers, in their priest-rid age,</div>
  <div class="i0">As impious and prophane, abhorred the stage:</div>
  <div class="i0">A troop of silly pilgrims, as 'tis said,</div>
  <div class="i0">Foolishly zealous, scandalously played,</div>
  <div class="i0">Instead of heroes, and of love's complaints,</div>
  <div class="i0">The angels, God, the Virgin, and the saints.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">At last, right reason did his laws reveal,</div>
  <div class="i0">And showed the folly of their ill-placed zeal,</div>
  <div class="i0">Silenced those nonconformists of the age,</div>
  <div class="i0">And raised the lawful heroes of the stage:</div>
  <div class="i0">Only the Athenian mask was laid aside,</div>
  <div class="i0">And chorus by the music was supplied.</div>
  <div class="i0">Ingenious love, inventive in new arts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Mingled in plays, and quickly touched our hearts:</div>
  <div class="i0">This passion never could resistance find,</div>
  <div class="i0">But knows the shortest passage to the mind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Paint then, I'm pleased my hero be in love;</div>
  <div class="i0">But let him not like a tame shepherd move;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let not Achilles be like Thyrsis seen,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or for a Cyrus show an Artamen;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">That struggling oft, his passions we may find,</div>
  <div class="i0">The frailty, not the virtue of his mind.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of romance heroes shun the low design;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet to great hearts some human frailties join:</div>
  <div class="i0">Achilles must with Homer's heat engage;</div>
  <div class="i0">For an affront I'm pleased to see him rage.</div>
  <div class="i0">Those little failings in your hero's heart</div>
  <div class="i0">Show that of man and nature he has part.</div>
  <div class="i0">To leave known rules you cannot be allowed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Make Agamemnon covetous and proud,</div>
  <div class="i0">Æneas in religious rites austere.</div>
  <div class="i0">Keep to each man his proper character.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Keep to each man his proper character.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of countries and of times the humours know;</div>
  <div class="i0">From different climates different customs grow:</div>
  <div class="i0">And strive to shun their fault, who vainly dress</div>
  <div class="i0">An antique hero like some modern ass;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who make old Romans like our English move,</div>
  <div class="i0">Show Cato sparkish, or make Brutus love.</div>
  <div class="i0">In a romance those errors are excused:</div>
  <div class="i0">There 'tis enough that, reading, we're amused:</div>
  <div class="i0">Rules too severe would there be useless found;</div>
  <div class="i0">But the strict scene must have a juster bound;</div>
  <div class="i0">Exact decorum we must always find.</div>
  <div class="i0">If then you form some hero in your mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Be sure your image with itself agree;</div>
  <div class="i0">For what he first appears, he still must be.</div>
  <div class="i0">Affected wits will naturally incline</div>
  <div class="i0">To paint their figures by their own design;</div>

  <div class="i0">Sorrow is humble, and dissolves in tears.</div>
  <div class="i0">Make not your Hecuba with fury rage,</div>

  <div class="i0">His sevenfold waters to the Euxine shore:</div>
  <div class="i0">These swoln expressions, this affected noise,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shows like some pedant that declaims to boys.</div>
  <div class="i0">In sorrow you must softer methods keep;</div>
  <div class="i0">And, to excite our tears, yourself must weep.</div>

  <div class="i1">The theatre for a young poet's rhymes</div>
  <div class="i0">Is a bold venture in our knowing times:</div>
  <div class="i0">An author cannot easily purchase fame;</div>
  <div class="i0">Critics are always apt to hiss, and blame:</div>
  <div class="i0">You may be judged by every ass in town,</div>
  <div class="i0">The privilege is bought for half-a-crown.</div>
  <div class="i0">To please, you must a hundred changes try;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes be humble, then must soar on high;</div>
  <div class="i0">In noble thoughts must everywhere abound,</div>
  <div class="i0">Be easy, pleasant, solid, and profound;</div>
  <div class="i0">To these you must surprising touches join,</div>
  <div class="i0">And show us a new wonder in each line;</div>
  <div class="i0">That all, in a just method well-designed,</div>
  <div class="i0">May leave a strong impression in the mind.</div>
  <div class="i0">These are the arts that tragedy maintain:</div>

<p class="p4">THE EPIC.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But the Heroic claims a loftier strain.</div>
  <div class="i0">In the narration of some great design,</div>
  <div class="i0">Invention, art, and fable, all must join:</div>
  <div class="i0">Here fiction must employ its utmost grace;</div>
  <div class="i0">All must assume a body, mind, and face:</div>
  <div class="i0">Each virtue a divinity is seen;</div>
  <div class="i0">Prudence is Pallas, Beauty, Paphos' queen.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not a cloud from whence swift lightnings fly,</div>
  <div class="i0">But Jupiter, that thunders from the sky;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor a rough storm that gives the sailor pain,</div>
  <div class="i0">But angry Neptune plowing up the main;</div>
  <div class="i0">Echo's no more an empty airy sound,</div>
  <div class="i0">But a fair nymph that weeps her lover drowned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus in the endless treasure of his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">The poet does a thousand figures find;</div>
  <div class="i0">Around the work his ornaments he pours,</div>
  <div class="i0">And strows with lavish hand his opening flowers.</div>

  <div class="i0">'Tis not a wonder if a tempest bore</div>
  <div class="i0">The Trojan fleet against the Libyan shore;</div>
  <div class="i0">From faithless fortune this is no surprise,</div>
  <div class="i0">For every day 'tis common to our eyes:</div>
  <div class="i0">But angry Juno, that she might destroy,</div>
  <div class="i0">And overwhelm the rest of ruined Troy;</div>
  <div class="i0">That Æolus, with the fierce goddess joined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Opened the hollow prisons of the wind;</div>
  <div class="i0">Till angry Neptune, looking o'er the main,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rebukes the tempest, calms the waves again,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their vessels from the dangerous quicksands steers.</div>
  <div class="i0">These are the springs that move our hopes and fears:</div>
  <div class="i0">Without these ornaments before our eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">The unsinewed poem languishes and dies:</div>
  <div class="i0">Your poet in his art will always fail,</div>
  <div class="i0">And tell you but a dull insipid tale.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain have our mistaken authors tried</div>
  <div class="i0">To lay these ancient ornaments aside,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thinking our God, and prophets that he sent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Might act like those the poets did invent,</div>
  <div class="i0">To fright poor readers in each line with hell,</div>
  <div class="i0">And talk of Satan, Ashtaroth, and Bel.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">The mysteries which Christians must believe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Disdain such shifting pageants to receive:</div>
  <div class="i0">The gospel offers nothing to our thoughts</div>
  <div class="i0">But penitence, or punishment for faults;</div>
  <div class="i0">And mingling falsehoods with those mysteries,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would make our sacred truths appear like lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">Besides, what pleasure can it be to hear</div>
  <div class="i0">The howlings of repining Lucifer,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose rage at your imagined hero flies,</div>
  <div class="i0">And oft with God himself disputes the prize?</div>
  <div class="i0">Tasso, you'll say, has done it with applause:&mdash;</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Yet though our age has so extolled his name,</div>
  <div class="i0">His works had never gained immortal fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">If holy Godfrey in his ecstasies</div>
  <div class="i0">Had only conquered Satan on his knees;</div>
  <div class="i0">If Tancred and Armida's pleasing form</div>

  <div class="i0">'Tis not, that Christian poems ought to be</div>
  <div class="i0">Filled with the fictions of idolatry;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, in a common subject, to reject</div>
  <div class="i0">The gods, and heathen ornaments neglect;</div>
  <div class="i0">To banish Tritons, who the seas invade,</div>
  <div class="i0">To take Pan's whistle, or the fates degrade,</div>
  <div class="i0">To hinder Charon in his leaky boat</div>
  <div class="i0">To pass the shepherd with the man of note,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is with vain scruples to disturb your mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">And search perfection you can never find:</div>
  <div class="i0">As well they may forbid us to present</div>
  <div class="i0">Prudence or Justice for an ornament,</div>
  <div class="i0">To paint old Janus with his front of brass,</div>
  <div class="i0">And take from Time his scythe, his wings, and glass,</div>
  <div class="i0">And everywhere, as 'twere idolatry,</div>
  <div class="i0">Banish descriptions from our poetry.</div>
  <div class="i0">Leave them their pious follies to pursue;</div>
  <div class="i0">But let our reason such vain fears subdue:</div>
  <div class="i0">And let us not, amongst our vanities,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the true God create a god of lies.</div>
  <div class="i0">In fable we a thousand pleasures see,</div>
  <div class="i0">And the smooth names seem made for poetry;</div>
  <div class="i0">As Hector, Alexander, Helen, Phyllis,</div>
  <div class="i0">Ulysses, Agamemnon, and Achilles:</div>
  <div class="i0">In such a crowd, the poet were to blame</div>
  <div class="i0">To chuse king Chilperic for his hero's name.</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes the name, being well or ill applied,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will the whole fortune of your work decide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Would you your reader never should be tired,</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Chuse some great hero, fit to be admired,</div>
  <div class="i0">In courage signal, and in virtue bright;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let even his very failings give delight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let his great actions our attention bind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like Cæsar, or like Scipio, frame his mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">And not like &OElig;dipus his perjured race;</div>
  <div class="i0">A common conqueror is a theme too base.</div>
  <div class="i0">Chuse not your tale of accidents too full;</div>
  <div class="i0">Too much variety may make it dull:</div>
  <div class="i0">Achilles' rage alone, when wrought with skill,</div>
  <div class="i0">Abundantly does a whole Iliad fill.</div>
  <div class="i0">Be your narrations lively, short, and smart;</div>
  <div class="i0">In your descriptions show your noblest art:</div>
  <div class="i0">There 'tis your poetry may be employed.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet you must trivial accidents avoid,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor imitate that fool, who, to describe</div>
  <div class="i0">The wondrous marches of the chosen tribe,</div>
  <div class="i0">Placed on the sides, to see their armies pass,</div>
  <div class="i0">The fishes staring through the liquid glass;</div>
  <div class="i0">Described a child, who, with his little hand,</div>
  <div class="i0">Picked up the shining pebbles from the sand.</div>
  <div class="i0">Such objects are too mean to stay our sight;</div>
  <div class="i0">Allow your work a just and nobler flight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Be your beginning plain; and take good heed</div>
  <div class="i0">Too soon you mount not on the airy steed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor tell your reader, in a thundering verse,</div>
  <div class="i0">"I sing the conqueror of the universe."</div>
  <div class="i0">What can an author after this produce?</div>
  <div class="i0">The labouring mountain must bring forth a mouse.</div>
  <div class="i0">Much better are we pleased with his address,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who, without making such vast promises,</div>
  <div class="i0">Says, in an easier style and plainer sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">"I sing the combats of that pious prince,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who from the Phrygian coasts his armies bore,</div>
  <div class="i0">And landed first on the Lavinian shore."</div>
  <div class="i0">His opening muse sets not the world on fire,</div>
  <div class="i0">And yet performs more than we can require:</div>

  <div class="i0">Of Styx and Acheron describe the floods,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Cæsar's wandering in the Elysian woods;</div>
  <div class="i0">With figures numberless his story grace,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every thing in beauteous colours trace.</div>
  <div class="i0">At once you may be pleasing and sublime:</div>
  <div class="i0">I hate a heavy melancholy rhyme:</div>
  <div class="i0">I'd rather read Orlando's comic tale,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than a dull author always stiff and stale,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who thinks himself dishonoured in his style,</div>
  <div class="i0">If on his works the Graces do but smile.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis said, that Homer, matchless in his art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stole Venus' girdle to engage the heart:</div>
  <div class="i0">His works indeed vast treasures do unfold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And whatsoe'er he touches turns to gold:</div>
  <div class="i0">All in his hands new beauty does acquire;</div>
  <div class="i0">He always pleases, and can never tire.</div>
  <div class="i0">A happy warmth he every where may boast;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor is he in too long digressions lost:</div>
  <div class="i0">His verses without rule a method find,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of themselves appear in order joined;</div>
  <div class="i0">All without trouble answers his intent;</div>
  <div class="i0">Each syllable is tending to the event.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let his example your endeavours raise;</div>
  <div class="i0">To love his writings is a kind of praise.</div>
  <div class="i1">A poem, where we all perfections find,</div>
  <div class="i0">Is not the work of a fantastic mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">There must be care, and time, and skill, and pains;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not the first heat of inexperienced brains.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet sometimes artless poets, when the rage</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a warm fancy does their minds engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Puffed with vain pride, presume they understand,</div>
  <div class="i0">And boldly take the trumpet in their hand:</div>
  <div class="i0">Their fustian muse each accident confounds;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor can she fly, but rise by leaps and bounds,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Till, their small stock of learning quickly spent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their poem dies for want of nourishment.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain mankind the hot-brained fool decries,</div>
  <div class="i0">No branding censures can unvail his eyes;</div>
  <div class="i0">With impudence the laurel they invade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Resolved to like the monsters they have made.</div>
  <div class="i0">Virgil, compared to them, is flat and dry;</div>
  <div class="i0">And Homer understood not poetry:</div>
  <div class="i0">Against their merit if this age rebel,</div>
  <div class="i0">To future times for justice they appeal.</div>
  <div class="i0">But waiting till mankind shall do them right,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bring their works triumphantly to light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Neglected heaps we in bye-corners lay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where they become to worms and moths a prey.</div>
  <div class="i0">Forgot, in dust and cobwebs let them rest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whilst we return from whence we first digrest.</div>
  <div class="i1">The great success which tragic writers found,</div>
  <div class="i0">In Athens first the comedy renowned.</div>
  <div class="i0">The abusive Grecian there, by pleasing ways,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dispersed his natural malice in his plays:</div>
  <div class="i0">Wisdom and virtue, honour, wit, and sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Were subject to buffooning insolence:</div>
  <div class="i0">Poets were publicly approved, and sought,</div>
  <div class="i0">That vice extolled, and virtue set at nought;</div>
  <div class="i0">A Socrates himself, in that loose age,</div>
  <div class="i0">Was made the pastime of a scoffing stage.</div>
  <div class="i0">At last the public took in hand the cause,</div>
  <div class="i0">And cured this madness by the power of laws;</div>
  <div class="i0">Forbade at any time, or any place,</div>
  <div class="i0">To name the person, or describe the face.</div>
  <div class="i0">The stage its ancient fury thus let fall,</div>
  <div class="i0">And comedy diverted without gall:</div>
  <div class="i0">By mild reproofs recovered minds diseased,</div>
  <div class="i0">And, sparing persons, innocently pleased.</div>
  <div class="i0">Each one was nicely shewn in this new glass,</div>
  <div class="i0">And smiled to think he was not meant the ass:</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">A miser oft would laugh at first, to find</div>
  <div class="i0">A faithful draught of his own sordid mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">And fops were with such care and cunning writ,</div>
  <div class="i0">They liked the piece for which themselves did sit.</div>
  <div class="i0">You, then, that would the comic laurels wear,</div>
  <div class="i0">To study nature be your only care.</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoe'er knows man, and by a curious art</div>
  <div class="i0">Discerns the hidden secrets of the heart;</div>
  <div class="i0">He who observes, and naturally can paint</div>
  <div class="i0">The jealous fool, the fawning sycophant,</div>
  <div class="i0">A sober wit, an enterprising ass,</div>
  <div class="i0">A humorous Otter,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> or a Hudibras,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">May safely in those noble lists engage,</div>
  <div class="i0">And make them act and speak upon the stage.</div>
  <div class="i0">Strive to be natural in all you write,</div>
  <div class="i0">And paint with colours that may please the sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Nature in various figures does abound,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in each mind are different humours found;</div>
  <div class="i0">A glance, a touch, discovers to the wise,</div>
  <div class="i0">But every man has not discerning eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">All-changing time does also change the mind,</div>
  <div class="i0">And different ages different pleasures find;</div>
  <div class="i0">Youth, hot and furious, cannot brook delay,</div>
  <div class="i0">By flattering vice is easily led away;</div>
  <div class="i0">Vain in discourse, inconstant in desire,</div>
  <div class="i0">In censure, rash; in pleasures, all on fire.</div>
  <div class="i0">The manly age does steadier thoughts enjoy;</div>
  <div class="i0">Power and ambition do his soul employ;</div>
  <div class="i0">Against the turns of fate he sets his mind;</div>
  <div class="i0">And by the past the future hopes to find.</div>
  <div class="i0">Decrepit age, still adding to his stores,</div>
  <div class="i0">For others heaps the treasure he adores;</div>
  <div class="i0">In all his actions keeps a frozen pace;</div>
  <div class="i0">Past times extols, the present to debase:</div>
  <div class="i0">Incapable of pleasures youth abuse,</div>
  <div class="i0">In others blames what age does him refuse.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Your actors must by reason be controuled;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let young men speak like young, old men like old.</div>
  <div class="i0">Observe the town, and study well the court;</div>
  <div class="i0">For thither various characters resort.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus 'twas great Jonson purchased his renown,</div>
  <div class="i0">And in his art had borne away the crown,</div>
  <div class="i0">If, less desirous of the people's praise,</div>
  <div class="i0">He had not with low farce debased his plays;</div>
  <div class="i0">Mixing dull buffoonry with wit refined,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Harlequin with noble Terence joined.</div>
  <div class="i0">When in the Fox I see the tortoise hist,</div>
  <div class="i0">I lose the author of the Alchemist.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></div>
  <div class="i0">The comic wit, born with a smiling air,</div>
  <div class="i0">Must tragic grief and pompous verse forbear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet may he not, as on a market-place,</div>
  <div class="i0">With bawdy jests amuse the populace;</div>
  <div class="i0">With well-bred conversation you must please,</div>
  <div class="i0">And your intrigue unravelled be with ease;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your action still should reason's rules obey,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor in an empty scene may lose its way.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your humble style must sometimes gently rise;</div>
  <div class="i0">And your discourse sententious be, and wise:</div>
  <div class="i0">The passions must to nature be confined;</div>
  <div class="i0">And scenes to scenes with artful weaving joined.</div>
  <div class="i0">Your wit must not unseasonably play;</div>
  <div class="i0">But follow business, never lead the way.</div>
  <div class="i0">Observe how Terence does this error shun:</div>
  <div class="i0">A careful father chides his amorous son;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then see that son, whom no advice can move,</div>
  <div class="i0">Forget those orders, and pursue his love:</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not a well-drawn picture we discover;</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis a true son, a father, and a lover.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I like an author that reforms the age,</div>
  <div class="i0">And keeps the right decorum of the stage;</div>
  <div class="i0">That always pleases by just reason's rule:</div>
  <div class="i0">But for a tedious droll, a quibbling fool,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who with low nauseous bawdry fills his plays,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let him be gone, and on two tressels raise</div>
  <div class="i0">Some Smithfield stage, where he may act his pranks,</div>
  <div class="i0">And make Jack-Puddings speak to mountebanks.</div>

<h3>CANTO IV.</h3>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span class="fontsize">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> Florence dwelt a doctor of renown,</div>
  <div class="i0">The scourge of God, and terror of the town,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who all the cant of physic had by heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">And never murdered but by rules of art.</div>
  <div class="i0">The public mischief was his private gain:</div>
  <div class="i0">Children their slaughtered parents sought in vain;</div>
  <div class="i0">A brother here his poisoned brother wept;</div>
  <div class="i0">Some bloodless died, and some by opium slept;</div>
  <div class="i0">Colds, at his presence, would to phrenzies turn,</div>
  <div class="i0">And agues, like malignant fevers, burn.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hated, at last, his practice gives him o'er;</div>
  <div class="i0">One friend, unkilled by drugs, of all his store,</div>
  <div class="i0">In his new country-house affords him place;</div>
  <div class="i0">('Twas a rich abbot, and a building ass.)</div>
  <div class="i0">Here first the doctor's talent came in play;</div>
  <div class="i0">He seems inspired, and talks like Wren or May;</div>
  <div class="i0">Of this new portico condemns the face,</div>
  <div class="i0">And turns the entrance to a better place;</div>
  <div class="i0">Designs the stair-case at the other end:</div>
  <div class="i0">His friend approves, does for his mason send.</div>
  <div class="i0">He comes; the doctor's arguments prevail;</div>
  <div class="i0">In short, to finish this our humorous tale,</div>
  <div class="i0">He Galen's dangerous science does reject,</div>
  <div class="i0">And from ill doctor turns good architect.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
  <div class="i1">In this example we may have our part;</div>
  <div class="i0">Rather be mason, ('tis a useful art,)</div>
  <div class="i0">Than a dull poet; for that trade accurst,</div>
  <div class="i0">Admits no mean betwixt the best and worst.</div>
  <div class="i0">In other sciences, without disgrace,</div>
  <div class="i0">A candidate may fill a second place;</div>
  <div class="i0">But poetry no medium can admit,</div>
  <div class="i0">No reader suffers an indifferent wit:</div>
  <div class="i0">The ruined stationers against him bawl,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Herringman<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> degrades him from his stall.</div>
  <div class="i0">Burlesque at least our laughter may excite;</div>
  <div class="i0">But a cold writer never can delight.</div>
  <div class="i0">The Counter-scuffle<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> has more wit and art,</div>
  <div class="i0">Than the stiff formal style of Gondibert.</div>
  <div class="i0">Be not affected with that empty praise</div>
  <div class="i0">Which your vain flatterers will sometimes raise;</div>
  <div class="i0">And when you read, with ecstasy will say,</div>
  <div class="i0">"The finished piece! the admirable play!"</div>
  <div class="i0">Which, when exposed to censure and to light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cannot endure a critic's piercing sight.</div>
  <div class="i0">A hundred authors' fates have been foretold,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Shadwell's works are printed, but not sold.</div>
  <div class="i0">Hear all the world; consider every thought;</div>
  <div class="i0">A fool by chance may stumble on a fault:</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet, when Apollo does your muse inspire,</div>
  <div class="i0">Be not impatient to expose your fire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor imitate the Settles of our times,</div>
  <div class="i0">Those tuneful readers of their own dull rhymes,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Those tuneful readers of their own dull rhymes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who seize on all the acquaintance they can meet,</div>
  <div class="i0">And stop the passengers that walk the street:</div>
  <div class="i0">There is no sanctuary you can chuse</div>
  <div class="i0">For a defence from their pursuing muse.</div>
  <div class="i0">I've said before, be patient when they blame;</div>
  <div class="i0">To alter for the better is no shame.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet yield not to a fool's impertinence;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sometimes conceited sceptics, void of sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">By their false taste condemn some finished part,</div>
  <div class="i0">And blame the noblest flights of wit and art.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain their fond opinions you deride,</div>
  <div class="i0">With their loved follies they are satisfied;</div>
  <div class="i0">And their weak judgment, void of sense and light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thinks nothing can escape their feeble sight:</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their dangerous counsels do not cure, but wound;</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To shun the storm they run your verse aground,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And thinking to escape a rock, are drowned.</div>
  <div class="i0">Chuse a sure judge to censure what you write,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose reason leads, and knowledge gives you light,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose steady hand will prove your faithful guide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And touch the darling follies you would hide:</div>
  <div class="i0">He, in your doubts, will carefully advise,</div>
  <div class="i0">And clear the mist before your feeble eyes.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis he will tell you, to what noble height</div>
  <div class="i0">A generous muse may sometimes take her flight;</div>
  <div class="i0">When too much fettered with the rules of art,</div>
  <div class="i0">May from her stricter bounds and limits part:</div>
  <div class="i0">But such a perfect judge is hard to see,</div>
  <div class="i0">And every rhymer knows not poetry;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nay some there are for writing verse extolled,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who know not Lucan's dross from Virgil's gold.</div>
  <div class="i1">Would you in this great art acquire renown?</div>
  <div class="i0">Authors, observe the rules I here lay down.</div>
  <div class="i0">In prudent lessons every where abound;</div>
  <div class="i0">With pleasant join the useful and the sound:</div>
  <div class="i0">A sober reader a vain tale will slight;</div>
  <div class="i0">He seeks as well instruction as delight.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Let all your thoughts to virtue be confined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still offering nobler figures to our mind:</div>
  <div class="i0">I like not those loose writers, who employ</div>
  <div class="i0">Their guilty muse, good manners to destroy;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who with false colours still deceive our eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">And show us vice dressed in a fair disguise.</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet do I not their sullen muse approve,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who from all modest writings banish love;</div>
  <div class="i0">That stript the playhouse of its chief intrigue,</div>
  <div class="i0">And make a murderer of Roderigue:</div>
  <div class="i0">The lightest love, if decently exprest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Will raise no vitious motions in our breast.</div>
  <div class="i0">Dido in vain may weep, and ask relief;</div>
  <div class="i0">I blame her folly, whilst I share her grief.</div>
  <div class="i0">A virtuous author, in his charming art,</div>
  <div class="i0">To please the sense needs not corrupt the heart:</div>
  <div class="i0">His heat will never cause a guilty fire:</div>
  <div class="i0">To follow virtue then be your desire.</div>
  <div class="i0">In vain your art and vigour are exprest;</div>
  <div class="i0">The obscene expression shows the infected breast.</div>
  <div class="i0">But, above all, base jealousies avoid,</div>
  <div class="i0">In which detracting poets are employed.</div>
  <div class="i0">A noble wit dares liberally commend,</div>
  <div class="i0">And scorns to grudge at his deserving friend.</div>
  <div class="i0">Base rivals, who true wit and merit hate,</div>
  <div class="i0">Caballing still against it with the great,</div>
  <div class="i0">Maliciously aspire to gain renown,</div>
  <div class="i0">By standing up, and pulling others down.</div>
  <div class="i0">Never debase yourself by treacherous ways,</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor by such abject methods seek for praise:</div>
  <div class="i0">Let not your only business be to write;</div>
  <div class="i0">Be virtuous, just, and in your friends delight.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis not enough your poems be admired;</div>
  <div class="i0">But strive your conversation be desired:</div>
  <div class="i0">Write for immortal fame; nor ever chuse</div>
  <div class="i0">Gold for the object of a generous muse.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">I know a noble wit may, without crime,</div>
  <div class="i0">Receive a lawful tribute for his time:</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet I abhor those writers, who despise</div>
  <div class="i0">Their honour, and alone their profits prize;</div>
  <div class="i0">Who their Apollo basely will degrade,</div>
  <div class="i0">And of a noble science make a trade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Before kind reason did her light display,</div>
  <div class="i0">And government taught mortals to obey,</div>
  <div class="i0">Men, like wild beasts, did nature's laws pursue,</div>
  <div class="i0">They fed on herbs, and drink from rivers drew;</div>
  <div class="i0">Their brutal force, on lust and rapine bent,</div>
  <div class="i0">Committed murder without punishment:</div>
  <div class="i0">Reason at last, by her all-conquering arts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Reduced these savages, and tuned their hearts;</div>
  <div class="i0">Mankind from bogs, and woods, and caverns calls,</div>
  <div class="i0">And towns and cities fortifies with walls:</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus fear of justice made proud rapine cease,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sheltered innocence by laws and peace.</div>
  <div class="i1">These benefits from poets we received;</div>
  <div class="i0">From whence are raised those fictions since believed,</div>
  <div class="i0">That Orpheus, by his soft harmonious strains,</div>
  <div class="i0">Tamed the fierce tygers of the Thracian plains;</div>
  <div class="i0">Amphion's notes, by their melodious powers,</div>
  <div class="i0">Drew rocks and woods, and raised the Theban towers:</div>
  <div class="i0">These miracles from numbers did arise;</div>
  <div class="i0">Since which, in verse heaven taught his mysteries,</div>
  <div class="i0">And by a priest, possessed with rage divine,</div>
  <div class="i0">Apollo spoke from his prophetic shrine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Soon after, Homer the old heroes praised,</div>
  <div class="i0">And noble minds by great examples raised;</div>
  <div class="i0">Then Hesiod did his Grecian swains incline</div>
  <div class="i0">To till the fields, and prune the bounteous vine.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus useful rules were, by the poet's aid,</div>
  <div class="i0">In easy numbers to rude men conveyed,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pleasingly their precepts did impart;</div>
  <div class="i0">First charmed the ear, and then engaged the heart;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The muses thus their reputation raised,</div>
  <div class="i0">And with just gratitude in Greece were praised.</div>
  <div class="i0">With pleasure mortals did their wonders see,</div>
  <div class="i0">And sacrificed to their divinity;</div>
  <div class="i0">But want, at last, base flattery entertained,</div>
  <div class="i0">And old Parnassus with this vice was stained;</div>
  <div class="i0">Desire of gain dazzling the poets' eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">Their works were filled with fulsome flatteries.</div>
  <div class="i0">Thus needy wits a vile revenue made,</div>
  <div class="i0">And verse became a mercenary trade.</div>
  <div class="i0">Debase not with so mean a vice thy art;</div>
  <div class="i0">If gold must be the idol of thy heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fly, fly the unfruitful Heliconian strand!</div>
  <div class="i0">Those streams are not enriched with golden sand;</div>
  <div class="i0">Great wits, as well as warriors, only gain</div>
  <div class="i0">Laurels and honours for their toil and pain.</div>
  <div class="i0">But what? an author cannot live on fame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or pay a reckoning with a lofty name:</div>
  <div class="i0">A poet, to whom fortune is unkind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who when he goes to bed has hardly dined,</div>
  <div class="i0">Takes little pleasure in Parnassus' dreams,</div>
  <div class="i0">Or relishes the Heliconian streams;</div>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Horace had ease and plenty when he writ,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And free from cares for money or for meat,</div>
  <div class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Did not expect his dinner from his wit.</div>
  <div class="i0">'Tis true; but verse is cherished by the great,</div>
  <div class="i0">And now none famish who deserve to eat:</div>
  <div class="i0">What can we fear, when virtue, arts, and sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">Receive the stars' propitious influence;</div>
  <div class="i0">When a sharp-sighted prince, by early grants,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rewards your merits, and prevents your wants?</div>
  <div class="i0">Sing then his glory, celebrate his fame;</div>
  <div class="i0">Your noblest theme is his immortal name.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let mighty Spenser raise his reverend head,</div>
  <div class="i0">Cowley and Denham start up from the dead;</div>

<h2><a name="TARQUIN_AND_TULLIA" id="TARQUIN_AND_TULLIA"></a>TARQUIN AND TULLIA.</h2>


<p>This piece, and that which immediately follows, bear no trace
of Dryden's hand. They have been attributed, by Mr Malone,
with much probability, to Mr Mainwaring, a violent Jacobite.
The satire is coarse and intemperate, without having that easy
flow of verse, and felicity of expression, which always distinguishes
the genuine productions of our author.</p>

<p>The comparison of William and Mary with Tarquin and
Tullia, was early insisted upon as a topic of reproach. It occurs
in a letter concerning the coronation medal, which, as is well
known, represented, on the reverse, the destruction of Phaeton.
The letter-writer says, that "one gentleman seeing the chariot, but
not understanding the Latin inscription, and having heard the
town talk of Tullia, who instigated her husband Tarquinius to
kill her father Servius Tullius king of the Romans, that he might
succeed him in the throne, and, as Livy says, caused her chariot
to be driven over his mangled body, cried out, 'Is this Tullia's
chariot?' This I say shocked me, and raised my anger against
the contriver, who had chosen so ill an emblem, which, upon so
superficial a view, brought such an odious history into men's
minds." <span class="smcap">Somers'</span> <cite>Tracts</cite>, p. 333.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_YOUNG_STATESMEN" id="ON_THE_YOUNG_STATESMEN"></a>ON THE YOUNG STATESMEN.</h2>


<p>The following verses have been ascribed to Dryden upon slight
authority, and contrary to internal evidence. They display a
good deal of the turn of wit, and structure of verse, which may be
observed in similar <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeux d'esprit</i> of Dorset, to whom I am tempted
to ascribe them, though the name of Dryden may have been
borrowed, to give them publicity.</p>

<p>They ought to have preceded, in point of time, those entitled
"Tarquin and Tullia," but were accidentally misplaced.</p>

<p>As nicknames are easily perpetuated, I observe, that these
verses entailed upon the young statesmen, the names of Chit Sunderland,
Chit Lory, &amp;c. in the satires of the day. This administration
came into office in the latter years of Charles II.'s reign.
The satire turns on a comparison between them and their predecessors
of what was called the Cabal. There is a parody on
these lines in the "State Poems," in which they are applied to
Stillingfleet.</p>

<p>This Essay contains the first detailed view of our author's opinions
concerning the Drama. In many things, particularly in
the main point of preference given to rhyme, he afterwards saw
cause to retract some of the principles here laid down. We
have endeavoured elsewhere to trace the progress and alteration
of Dryden's sentiments upon these subjects.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But the reader's
attention may be here called to the elegant form into which
he has thrown his Essay, and which has been so often in vain
followed by clumsy imitators. The scene of the dialogue, and the
striking incident by which it is introduced, have the happiest effect
in arresting the attention; and infinite address is displayed
in conducting the subject, from the distant noise of a bloody
sea-fight, into the academic prolusions of dramatic criticism.</p>

<p>The speakers in the dialogue are four; three of whom are persons
"whom their wit and quality have made known to all the
town." The fourth, of whose properties the author speaks more
modestly, is <span class="smcap">Neander</span>, under which feigned appellation Dryden
himself is figured. In corroboration of this, Mr Malone produces
two instances, in which Dryden is called Neander by the famous
Corinna, or Eliza Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Moreover, the curious reader must
be informed, that there is an anagram in the name of the second
personage, <span class="smcap">Lisideius</span>, which points him out to be Sir Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>Sedley, or Sidley, for his name was spelled both ways.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> <span class="smcap">Crites</span>,
the advocate for blank verse, is Sir Robert Howard, our author's
friend and brother-in-law; who, in the preface to his
plays, published in 1665, had censured rhiming tragedies as unnatural.
Prior has assured us, that <span class="smcap">Eugenius</span> means the witty
Earl of Dorset, then Lord Buckhurst.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> A very critical observer
may remark an inaccuracy in introducing his lordship as listening
to the sound of a sea-fight, in which he was himself actually
engaged.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But Dryden did not mean to identify his speakers,
and those shadowed out under them, otherwise than in their capacity
of critics and authors.</p>

<p>Dryden has, with infinite address, avoided, or overcome, the obstacles
which commonly attend an argumentative discussion, in form
of a dialogue. The author of such disputations, in general, so obviously
favours one of the combatants, that we as soon expect Hector
to slay Achilles, or Turnus to defeat Æneas, as nourish the least hope
of the unfriended champion making any effectual resistance. Besides,
in prepared arguments of this sort, as in prepared jests on the
stage, there is an obvious opening left for those thrusts on which the
author chiefly depends for success; so that, instead of admiring
the victor, we are angry at the bad address of his antagonist. All
these obstacles Dryden has contrived to surmount, by the number
of his characters, and the variety of their dialogue, where not
only the argument of Neander's antagonists is fairly stated, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the topics are so judiciously varied, that the reader is brought to
the point which the author aims at, without stiffness or constraint,
as if in the ordinary flow of literary conversation. Thus, as we
never see the purpose which Dryden wishes to attain, we arrive
at his conclusion without fatigue or prejudice.</p>

<p>The "Essay on Dramatic Poetry" was assailed by several critics.
Martin Clifford, of the Charter-House, accused our author of pilfering
from the French critics, in the second of four very abusive
letters. The only existing edition of these diatribes is one in 1687;
but, from their date and import, this may have been a reprint.
Sir Robert Howard also attacked the Essay, in the preface to his
"Duke of Lerma," which led Dryden to assert his preference of
rhyming tragedies, in the Defence prefixed to the "Indian Emperor."
See Vol. III. p. 263.</p>

<p>This Essay was first published in 1668, or perhaps in the December
preceding. Sixteen years afterwards, Dryden bestowed on
it a thorough revisal; and having, in many places, altered and
amended the expression with unusual care, he published a second
edition in 1684, with the following dedication to Lord Buckhurst,
afterwards Earl of Dorset.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MY LORD,</p>

<p><span class="first drop">A</span><span class="smcap">s</span> I was lately reviewing my loose papers, amongst
the rest I found this Essay; the writing of
which, in this rude and indigested manner, wherein
your lordship now sees it, served as an amusement
to me in the country, when the violence of
the last plague had driven me from the town.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Seeing, then, our theatres shut up, I was engaged
in these kind of thoughts with the same delight,
with which men think upon their absent mistresses.
I confess I find many things in this discourse,
which I do not now approve; my judgment being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
not a little altered since the writing of it, but
whether for the better, or the worse, I know not:
neither, indeed, is it much material in an Essay,
where all I have said is problematical. For the
way of writing plays in verse, which I have seemed
to favour, I have, since that time, laid the practice
of it aside, till I have more leisure, because
I find it troublesome and slow: But I am no way
altered from my opinion of it, at least with any
reasons which have opposed it.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> For your lordship
may easily observe, that none are very violent
against it, but those who either have not attempted
it, or who have succeeded ill in their attempt.
It is enough for me to have your lordship's example
for my excuse in that little which I have done in
it; and I am sure my adversaries can bring no such
arguments against verse, as those with which the
fourth act of "Pompey" will furnish me in its defence.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Yet, my lord, you must suffer me a little
to complain of you, that you too soon withdraw
from us a contentment, of which we expected the
continuance, because you gave it us so early. It
is a revolt, without occasion, from your party,
where your merits had already raised you to the
highest commands, and where you have not the excuse
of other men, that you have been ill used, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
therefore laid down arms. I know no other quarrel
you can have to verse, than that which Spurina
had to his beauty, when he tore and mangled the
features of his face, only because they pleased too
well the sight.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> It was an honour which seemed
to wait for you, to lead out a new colony of writers
from the mother-nation: and, upon the first spreading
of your ensigns, there had been many in a readiness
to have followed so fortunate a leader; if
not all, yet the better part of poets:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pars, indocili melior grege; mollis et exspes</i></div>
  <div class="i1"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Inominata perprimat cubilia</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I am almost of opinion, that we should force you to accept of the
command, as sometimes the prætorian bands have compelled their captains
to receive the empire. The court, which is the best and surest judge of
writing, has generally allowed of verse; and, in the town, it has found
favourers of wit and quality. As for your own particular, my lord, you
have yet youth and time enough to give part of them to the divertisement
of the public, before you enter into the serious and more unpleasant
business of the world. That which the French poet said of the temple of
Love, may be as well applied to the temple of the Muses. The words, as
near as I can remember them, were these:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le jeune homme à mauvaise grace,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">N'ayant pas adoré dans le Temple d'Amour;</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il faut qu'il entre; et pour le sage</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Si ce n'est pas son vrai sejour,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C'est un gîte sur son passage</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I leave the words to work their effect upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
lordship in their own language, because no other can so well express
the nobleness of the thought; and wish you may be soon called to bear a
part in the affairs of the nation, where I know the world expects you,
and wonders why you have been so long forgotten; there being no person
amongst our young nobility, on whom the eyes of all men are so much bent.
But, in the mean time, your lordship may imitate the course of nature,
who gives us the flower before the fruit; that I may speak to you in the
language of the Muses, which I have taken from an excellent poem to the
king:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">As Nature, when she fruit designs, thinks fit</div>
  <div class="i0">By beauteous blossoms to proceed to it;</div>
  <div class="i0">And while she does accomplish all the spring,</div>
  <div class="i0">Birds to her secret operations sing.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I confess, I have no greater reason, in addressing
this Essay to your lordship, than that it might
awaken in you the desire of writing something, in
whatever kind it be, which might be an honour to
our age and country. And methinks it might have
the same effect on you, which Homer tells us the
fight of the Greeks and Trojans before the fleet,
had on the spirit of Achilles; who, though he had
resolved not to engage, yet found a martial warmth
to steal upon him at the sight of blows, the sound
of trumpets, and the cries of fighting men. For
my own part, if, in treating of this subject, I sometimes
dissent from the opinion of better wits, I declare
it is not so much to combat their opinions, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
to defend my own, which were first made public.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Sometimes, like a scholar in a fencing-school, I put
forth myself, and show my own ill play, on purpose
to be better taught. Sometimes I stand desperately
to my arms, like the foot when deserted
by their horse, not in hope to overcome, but only
to yield on more honourable terms. And yet, my
lord, this war of opinions, you well know, has fallen
out among the writers of all ages, and sometimes
betwixt friends. Only it has been prosecuted by
some, like pedants, with violence of words; and
managed by others like gentlemen, with candour
and civility. Even Tully had a controversy with
his dear Atticus; and in one of his dialogues makes
him sustain the part of an enemy in philosophy,
who, in his letters, is his confident of state, and
made privy to the most weighty affairs of the Roman
senate. And the same respect which was paid
by Tully to Atticus, we find returned to him afterwards
by Cæsar, on a like occasion, who, answering
his book in praise of Cato, made it not so much
his business to condemn Cato, as to praise Cicero.</p>

<p>But that I may decline some part of the encounter
with my adversaries, whom I am neither willing
to combat, nor well able to resist; I will give your
lordship the relation of a dispute betwixt some of
our wits on the same subject, in which they did
not only speak of plays in verse, but mingled, in
the freedom of discourse, some things of the ancient,
many of the modern, ways of writing; comparing
those with these, and the wits of our nation
with those of others: it is true they differed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
their opinions, as it is probable they would: neither
do I take upon me to reconcile, but to relate them;
and that, as Tacitus professes of himself, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sine studio
partium, aut irâ</i>, without passion, or interest;
leaving your lordship to decide it in favour of which
part you shall judge most reasonable, and withal,

honour of our English writers, from the censure of those who unjustly
prefer the French before them. This I intimate, lest any should think
me so exceeding vain, as to teach others an art which they understand
much better than myself. But if this incorrect Essay, written in the

so that all men being alarmed with it, and in a
dreadful suspense of the event, which they knew
was then deciding, every one went following the
sound as his fancy led him; and leaving the town
almost empty, some took towards the Park, some
cross the river, others down it; all seeking the
noise in the depth of silence.</p>

<p>Amongst the rest, it was the fortune of Eugenius,
Crites, Lisideius, and Neander, to be in company
together: three of them persons whom their wit
and quality have made known to all the town; and
whom I have chose to hide under these borrowed
names, that they may not suffer by so ill a relation
as I am going to make of their discourse.</p>

<p>Taking then a barge, which a servant of Lisideius
had provided for them, they made haste to shoot
the bridge, and left behind them that great fall of
waters which hindered them from hearing what they
desired: after which, having disengaged themselves
from many vessels which rode at anchor in the Thames,
and almost blocked up the passage towards Greenwich,
they ordered the watermen to let fall their
oars more gently; and then every one favouring
his own curiosity with a strict silence, it was not
long ere they perceived the air to break about them
like the noise of distant thunder, or of swallows in a
chimney: those little undulations of sound, though
almost vanishing before they reached them, yet still
seeming to retain somewhat of their first horror
which they had betwixt the fleets. After they had
attentively listened till such time as the sound by
little and little went from them,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Eugenius, lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
up his head, and taking notice of it, was the
first who congratulated to the rest that happy omen
of our nation's victory: adding, that we had but
this to desire in confirmation of it, that we might
hear no more of that noise which was now leaving
the English coast. When the rest had concurred in
the same opinion, Crites, a person of a sharp judgement,
and somewhat too delicate a taste in wit,
which the world hath mistaken in him for ill nature,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
said, smiling to us, that if the concernment of this
battle had not been so exceeding great, he could scarce
have wished the victory at the price he knew he
must pay for it, in being subject to the reading and
hearing of so many ill verses as he was sure would
be made on that subject. Adding, that no argument
could 'scape some of those eternal rhymers,
who watch a battle with more diligence than the
ravens and birds of prey; and the worst of them
surest to be first in upon the quarry; while the better
able, either out of modesty writ not at all, or
set that due value upon their poems, as to let them
be often desired, and long expected. There are
some of those impertinent people of whom you
speak, answered Lisideius, who, to my knowledge,
are already so provided, either way, that they can
produce not only a panegyric upon the victory,
but, if need be, a funeral elegy on the duke; wherein,
after they have crowned his valour with many
laurels, they will at last deplore the odds under
which he fell, concluding, that his courage deserved
a better destiny. All the company smiled at the
conceit of Lisideius; but Crites, more eager than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
before, began to make particular exceptions against
some writers, and said, the public magistrate ought
to send betimes to forbid them; and that it concerned
the peace and quiet of all honest people,
that ill poets should be as well silenced as seditious
preachers. In my opinion, replied Eugenius, you
pursue your point too far; for as to my own particular,
I am so great a lover of poesy, that I could
wish them all rewarded, who attempt but to do
well; at least, I would not have them worse used
than one of their brethren was by Sylla the dictator:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quem in concione vidimus</i>, (says Tully,) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum ei
libellum malus poeta de populo subjecisset, quod epigramma
in eum fecisset tantummodo alternis versibus
longiusculis, statim ex iis rebus quas tunc vendebat
jubere ei præmium tribui, sub ea conditione ne quid
postea scriberet</i>. I could wish with all my heart,
replied Crites, that many whom we know were
as bountifully thanked upon the same condition,
that they would never trouble us again. For amongst
others, I have a mortal apprehension of two poets,
whom this victory, with the help of both her wings,
will never be able to escape. 'Tis easy to guess
whom you intend, said Lisideius; and without
naming them, I ask you if one of them does not
perpetually pay us with clenches upon words, and
a certain clownish kind of raillery?<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> If now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
then he does not offer a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">catachresis</i> or <i>Cleivelandism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
wresting and torturing a word into another meaning:
in fine, if he be not one of those whom the
French would call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un mauvais buffon</i>; one who is
so much a well-willer to the satire, that he intends
at least to spare no man; and though he cannot
strike a blow to hurt any, yet he ought to be punished
for the malice of the action; as our witches
are justly hanged, because they think themselves to
be such; and suffer deservedly for believing they
did mischief, because they meant it.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> You have
described him, said Crites, so exactly, that I am
afraid to come after you with my other extremity
of poetry: he is one of those, who, having had some
advantage of education and converse, knows better
than the other what a poet should be, but puts it
into practice more unluckily than any man. His
style and matter are every where alike; he is the
most calm, peaceable writer you ever read: he never
disquiets your passions with the least concernment,
but still leaves you in as even a temper as he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
you; he is a very leveller in poetry: he creeps along
with ten little words in every line, and helps out
his numbers with <i>For to</i>, and <i>Unto</i>, and all the pretty
expletives he can find, till he drags them to the
end of another line; while the sense is left tired
half way behind it: he doubly starves all his verses,
first, for want of thought, and then of expression.
His poetry neither has wit in it, nor seems to have
it; like him in Martial:</p>

<p class="center"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pauper videri</i> Cinna <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vult, et est pauper</i>.</p>

<p>He affects plainness, to cover his want of imagination: when he writes
the serious way, the highest flight of his fancy is some miserable
antithesis or seeming contradiction; and in the comic, he is still
reaching at some thin conceit, the ghost of a jest, and that too flies
before him, never to be caught. These swallows which we see before us
on the Thames, are the just resemblance of his wit: you may observe how
near the water they stoop, how many proffers they make to dip, and yet
how seldom they touch it; and when they do, 'tis but the surface: they
skim over it but to catch a gnat, and then mount into the air and leave
it.&mdash;Well, gentlemen, said Eugenius, you may speak your pleasure of
these authors; but though I and some few more about the town may give
you a peaceable hearing, yet assure yourselves, there are multitudes who
would think you malicious, and them injured; especially him whom you
first described. He is the very Withers of the city:<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> they have bought more editions
of his works than would serve to lay under all
their pies at the Lord Mayor's Christmas. When
his famous poem first came out in the year 1660,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
I have seen them reading it in the midst of Change-time;
nay, so vehement they were at it, that they
lost their bargain by the candles' ends.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But what
will you say if he has been received amongst great persons? I can
assure you he is, this day, the envy of one, who is lord in the art of
quibbling; and who does not take it well, that any man should intrude
so far into his province. All I would wish, replied Crites, is, that
they who love his writings, may still admire him, and his fellow poet:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Qui Bavium non odit</i>, &amp;c. is curse sufficient. And farther, added
Lisideius, I believe there is no man who writes well, but would think he
had hard measure, if their admirers should praise any thing of his: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nam
quos contemnimus, eorum quoque laudes contemnimus</i>. There are so few who
write well in this age, said Crites, that methinks any praises should be
welcome; they neither rise to the dignity of the last age, nor to any of
the ancients: and we may cry out of the writers of this time, with more
reason than Petronius of his, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pace vestrâ liceat dixisse, primi omnium
eloquentiam perdidistis</i>: you have debauched the true old poetry so far,
that nature, which is the soul of it, is not in any of your writings.</p>

<p>If your quarrel (said Eugenius) to those who now write, be grounded
only on your reverence to antiquity, there is no man more ready to adore
those great Greeks and Romans than I am: but, on the other side, I cannot
think so contemptibly of the age in which I live, or so dishonourably
of my own country, as not to judge we equal the ancients in most kinds
of poesy, and in some surpass them; neither know I any reason why I may
not be as zealous for the reputation of our age, as we find the ancients
themselves were in reverence to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
lived before them. For you hear your Horace saying,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Indignor quidquam reprehendi, non quia crassé</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Compositum, illepidève putetur, sed quia nuper</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And after:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Si meliora dies, ut vina, poemata reddit,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Scire velim, pretium chartis quotus arroget annus?</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I see I am engaging in a wide dispute, where the arguments are not
like to reach close on either side; for poesy is of so large an extent,
and so many, both of the ancients and moderns, have done well in all
kinds of it, that in citing one against the other, we shall take up more
time this evening, than each man's occasions will allow him: therefore I
would ask Crites to what part of poesy he would confine his arguments,
and whether he would defend the general cause of the ancients against the
moderns, or oppose any age of the moderns against this of ours.</p>

<p>Crites, a little while considering upon this demand, told Eugenius,
that if he pleased he would limit their dispute to Dramatic Poesy; in
which he thought it not difficult to prove, either that the ancients were
superior to the moderns, or the last age to this of ours.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Eugenius was somewhat surprised, when he heard
Crites make choice of that subject. For aught I
see, said he, I have undertaken a harder province
than I imagined; for, though I never judged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
plays of the Greek or Roman poets comparable to ours, yet, on the other
side, those we now see acted come short of many which were written in
the last age. But my comfort is, if we are overcome, it will be only by
our own countrymen: and if we yield to them in this one part of poesy,
we more surpass them in all the other; for in the epic or lyric way, it
will be hard for them to shew us one such amongst them, as we have many
now living, or who lately were. They can produce nothing so courtly writ,
or which expresses so much the conversation of a gentleman, as Sir John
Suckling; nothing so even, sweet, and flowing, as Mr Waller; nothing
so majestic, so correct, as Sir John Denham; nothing so elevated, so
copious, and full of spirit, as Mr Cowley. As for the Italian, French,
and Spanish plays, I can make it evident, that those who now write,
surpass them; and that the drama is wholly ours.</p>

<p>All of them were thus far of Eugenius his opinion, that the sweetness
of English verse was never understood or practised by our fathers; even
Crites himself did not much oppose it: and every one was willing to
acknowledge how much our poesy is improved, by the happiness of some
writers yet living; who first taught us to mould our thoughts into easy
and significant words, to retrench the superfluities of expression, and
to make our rhyme so properly a part of the verse, that it should never
mislead the sense, but itself be led and governed by it.</p>

<p>Eugenius was going to continue this discourse, when Lisideius told
him, that it was necessary, before they proceeded further, to take a
standing measure of their controversy; for how was it possible to be
decided, who wrote the best plays, before we know what a play should be?
but, this once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
agreed on by both parties, each might have recourse to it, either
to prove his own advantages, or to discover the failings of his
adversary.</p>

<p>He had no sooner said this, but all desired the favour of him to give
the definition of a play; and they were the more importunate, because
neither Aristotle, nor Horace, nor any other, who had writ of that
subject, had ever done it.</p>

<p>Lisideius, after some modest denials, at last confessed he had a
rude notion of it; indeed rather a description than a definition; but
which served to guide him in his private thoughts, when he was to make
a judgment of what others writ: that he conceived a play ought to be,
"A just and lively image of human nature, representing its passions and
humours, and the changes of fortune to which it is subject, for the
delight and instruction of mankind."</p>

<p>This definition (though Crites raised a logical objection against
it&mdash;that it was only <i>à genere et fine</i>, and so not altogether
perfect) was yet well received by the rest: and after they had given
order to the watermen to turn their barge, and row softly, that they
might take the cool of the evening in their return, Crites, being desired
by the company to begin, spoke on behalf of the ancients, in this
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>If confidence presage a victory, Eugenius, in his own opinion, has
already triumphed over the ancients: nothing seems more easy to him,
than to overcome those whom it is our greatest praise to have imitated
well; for we do not only build upon their foundations, but by their
models. Dramatic Poesy had time enough, reckoning from Thespis (who first
invented it) to Aristophanes, to be born, to grow up, and to flourish in
maturity. It has been observed of arts and sciences, that in one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the same century they have arrived to great perfection; and no wonder,
since every age has a kind of universal genius, which inclines those that
live in it to some particular studies: the work then being pushed on by
many hands, must of necessity go forward.</p>

<p>Is it not evident, in these last hundred years, (when the study of
philosophy has been the business of all the Virtuosi in Christendom,)
that almost a new nature has been revealed to us? that more errors of the
school have been detected, more useful experiments in philosophy have
been made, more noble secrets in optics, medicine, anatomy, astronomy,
discovered, than in all those credulous and doting ages from Aristotle
to us?&mdash;so true it is, that nothing spreads more fast than science,
when rightly and generally cultivated.</p>

<p>Add to this, the more than common emulation that was in those times,
of writing well; which though it be found in all ages, and all persons
that pretend to the same reputation, yet poesy being then in more
esteem than now it is, had greater honours decreed to the professors
of it, and consequently the rivalship was more high between them. They
had judges ordained to decide their merit, and prizes to reward it;
and historians have been diligent to record of Æschylus, Euripides,
Sophocles, Lycophron, and the rest of them, both who they were that
vanquished in these wars of the theatre, and how often they were crowned:
while the Asian kings and Grecian commonwealths scarce afforded them
a nobler subject, than the unmanly luxuries of a debauched court, or
giddy intrigues of a factious city:&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alit æmulatio ingenia, (says
Paterculus) et nunc invidia, nunc admiratio incitationem accendit</i>:
Emulation is the spur of wit; and sometimes envy, sometimes admiration,
quickens our endeavours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>But now since the rewards of honour are taken away, that virtuous
emulation is turned into direct malice; yet so slothful, that it contents
itself to condemn and cry down others, without attempting to do better:
'tis a reputation too unprofitable, to take the necessary pains for it;
yet wishing they had it, that desire is incitement enough to hinder
others from it. And this, in short, Eugenius, is the reason, why you
have now so few good poets, and so many severe judges. Certainly, to
imitate the ancients well, much labour and long study is required;
which pains, I have already shewn, our poets would want encouragement
to take, if yet they had ability to go through the work. Those ancients
have been faithful imitators, and wise observers of that nature which
is so torn and ill represented in our plays; they have handed down to
us a perfect resemblance of her; which we, like ill copiers, neglecting
to look on, have rendered monstrous, and disfigured. But, that you may
know how much you are indebted to those your masters, and be ashamed
to have so ill requited them, I must remember you, that all the rules
by which we practise the drama at this day, (either such as relate to
the justness and symmetry of the plot; or the episodical ornaments,
such as descriptions, narrations, and other beauties, which are not
essential to the play;) were delivered to us from the observations which
Aristotle made, of those poets, who either lived before him, or were his
contemporaries. We have added nothing of our own, except we have the
confidence to say, our wit is better; of which none boast in this our
age, but such as understand not theirs. Of that book which Aristotle has
left us, ωερὶ τῆς Ποιητικῆς, Horace his "Art of Poetry," is an
excellent comment, and, I believe, restores to us that Second Book of his
concerning comedy, which is wanting in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of these two have been extracted the famous rules which the French
call <cite>Des Trois Unites</cite>, or the Three Unities, which ought to be observed
in every regular play; namely, of time, place, and action.</p>

<p>The unity of time they comprehend in twenty-four hours, the compass of
a natural day, or as near as it can be contrived; and the reason of it is
obvious to every one,&mdash;that the time of the feigned action, or fable
of the play, should be proportioned as near as can be to the duration of
that time in which it is represented: since therefore all plays are acted
on the theatre in a space of time much within the compass of twenty-four
hours, that play is to be thought the nearest imitation of nature, whose
plot or action is confined within that time. And, by the same rule which
concludes this general proportion of time, it follows, that all the parts
of it are (as near as may be) to be equally subdivided; namely, that
one act take not up the supposed time of half a day, which is out of
proportion to the rest; since the other four are then to be straitened
within the compass of the remaining half: for it is unnatural, that one
act, which being spoke or written, is not longer than the rest, should
be supposed longer by the audience; it is therefore the poet's duty, to
take care, that no act should be imagined to exceed the time in which it
is represented on the stage; and that the intervals and inequalities of
time be supposed to fall out between the acts.</p>

<p>This rule of time, how well it has been observed by the ancients, most
of their plays will witness. You see them in their tragedies, (wherein to
follow this rule is certainly most difficult,) from the very beginning of
their plays, falling close into that part of the story which they intend
for the action, or principal object of it, leaving the former part to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
delivered by narration: so that they set the audience, as it were, at
the post where the race is to be concluded; and saving them the tedious
expectation of seeing the poet set out and ride the beginning of the
course, they suffer you not to behold him, till he is in sight of the
goal, and just upon you.</p>

<p>For the second unity, which is that of place, the ancients meant by
it, that the scene ought to be continued through the play, in the same
place where it was laid in the beginning: for the stage, on which it
is represented, being but one and the same place, it is unnatural to
conceive it many; and those far distant from one another. I will not
deny, but by the variation of painted scenes, the fancy (which in these
cases will contribute to its own deceit) may sometimes imagine it several
places, with some appearance of probability; yet it still carries the
greater likelihood of truth, if those places be supposed so near each
other, as in the same town or city, which may all be comprehended under
the larger denomination of one place: for a greater distance will bear no
proportion to the shortness of time which is allotted, in the acting, to
pass from one of them to another. For the observation of this, next to
the ancients, the French are to be most commended. They tie themselves so
strictly to the unity of place, that you never see in any of their plays,
a scene changed in the middle of an act: if the act begins in a garden, a
street, or chamber, 'tis ended in the same place; and that you may know
it to be the same, the stage is so supplied with persons, that it is
never empty all the time: he who enters second, has business with him who
was on before; and before the second quits the stage, a third appears who
has business with him. This Corneille calls <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la liaison des Scenes</i>, the
continuity or joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of the scenes; and 'tis a good mark of a well-contrived play, when all
the persons are known to each other, and every one of them has some
affairs with all the rest.</p>

<p>As for the third unity, which is that of action, the ancients meant
no other by it than what the logicians do by their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finis</i>, the end or
scope of any action; that which is the first in intention, and last in
execution. Now the poet is to aim at one great and complete action, to
the carrying on of which all things in his play, even the very obstacles,
are to be subservient; and the reason of this is as evident as any of the
former.</p>

<p>For two actions equally laboured and driven on by the writer, would
destroy the unity of the poem; it would be no longer one play, but two:
not but that there may be many actions in a play, as Ben Jonson has
observed in his "Discoveries;"<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> but they
must be all subservient to the great one, which our language happily
expresses in the name of under-plots: such as in Terence's "Eunuch" is
the difference and reconcilement of Thais and Phædria, which is not the
chief business of the play, but promotes the marriage of Chærea and
Chremes's sister, principally intended by the poet. There ought to be but
one action, says Corneille, that is, one complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
action, which leaves the mind of the audience in a full repose; but this
cannot be brought to pass, but by many other imperfect actions, which
conduce to it, and hold the audience in a delightful suspense of what
will be.</p>

<p>If by these rules (to omit many other drawn from the precepts and
practice of the ancients) we should judge our modern plays, 'tis
probable, that few of them would endure the trial: that which should be
the business of a day, takes up in some of them an age; instead of one
action, they are the epitomes of a man's life; and for one spot of ground
(which the stage should represent) we are sometimes in more countries
than the map can show us.</p>

<p>But if we allow the ancients to have contrived well, we must
acknowledge them to have written better. Questionless we are deprived
of a great stock of wit in the loss of Menander among the Greek poets,
and of Cæcilius, Afranius, and Varius, among the Romans. We may guess at
Menander's excellency, by the plays of Terence, who translated some of
his; and yet wanted so much of him, that he was called by C. Cæsar the
half-Menander; and may judge of Varius, by the testimonies of Horace,
Martial, and Velleius Paterculus. 'Tis probable that these, could they
be recovered, would decide the controversy; but so long as Aristophanes
and Plautus are extant, while the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles, and
Seneca, are in our hands, I can never see one of those plays which are
now written, but it increases my admiration of the ancients. And yet I
must acknowledge further, that to admire them as we ought, we should
understand them better than we do. Doubtless many things appear flat to
us, the wit of which depended on some custom or story, which never came
to our knowledge; or perhaps on some criticism in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
language, which being so long dead, and only remaining in their books,
'tis not possible they should make us understand perfectly. To read
Macrobius, explaining the propriety and elegancy of many words in Virgil,
which I had before passed over without consideration, as common things,
is enough to assure me, that I ought to think the same of Terence; and
that in the purity of his style, (which Tully so much valued, that he
ever carried his works about him,) there is yet left in him great room
for admiration, if I knew but where to place it. In the mean time, I
must desire you to take notice, that the greatest man of the last age
(Ben Jonson) was willing to give place to them in all things: he was
not only a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of all
the others; you track him every where in their snow. If Horace, Lucan,
Petronius Arbiter, Seneca, and Juvenal, had their own from him, there are
few serious thoughts which are new in him: you will pardon me, therefore,
if I presume he loved their fashion, when he wore their clothes.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
But since I have otherwise a great veneration for
him, and you, Eugenius, prefer him above all
other poets,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> I will use no farther argument to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
than his example: I will produce before you father Ben, dressed in all
the ornaments and colours of the ancients; you will need no other guide
to our party, if you follow him; and whether you consider the bad plays
of our age, or regard the good plays of the last, both the best and worst
of the modern poets will equally instruct you to admire the ancients.</p>

<p>Crites had no sooner left speaking, but Eugenius, who had waited with
some impatience for it, thus began:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have observed in your speech, that the former part of it is
convincing, as to what the moderns have profited by the rules of the
ancients; but in the latter you are careful to conceal how much they have
excelled them. We own all the helps we have from them, and want neither
veneration nor gratitude, while we acknowledge, that to overcome them we
must make use of the advantages we have received from them: but to these
assistances we have joined our own industry; for, had we sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
down with a dull imitation of them, we might then have lost somewhat of
the old perfection, but never acquired any that was new. We draw not
therefore after their lines, but those of nature; and having the life
before us, besides the experience of all they knew, it is no wonder if
we hit some airs and features which they have missed. I deny not what
you urge of arts and sciences, that they have flourished in some ages
more than others; but your instance in philosophy makes for me: for if
natural causes be more known now than in the time of Aristotle, because
more studied, it follows, that poesy and other arts may, with the same
pains, arrive still nearer to perfection; and, that granted, it will rest
for you to prove, that they wrought more perfect images of human life,
than we; which seeing in your discourse you have avoided to make good,
it shall now be my task to shew you some part of their defects, and some
few excellencies of the moderns. And I think there is none among us can
imagine I do it enviously, or with purpose to detract from them; for what
interest of fame or profit can the living lose by the reputation of the
dead? On the other side, it is a great truth which Velleius Paterculus
affirms: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Audita visis libentius laudamus; et præsentia invidiâ,
præterita admiratione prosequimur; et his nos obrui, illis instrui
credimus</i>: that praise or censure is certainly the most sincere, which
unbribed posterity shall give us.</p>

<p>Be pleased then, in the first place, to take notice, that the Greek
poesy, which Crites has affirmed to have arrived to perfection in the
reign of the old comedy, was so far from it, that the distinction of
it into acts was not known to them; or if it were, it is yet so darkly
delivered to us, that we cannot make it out.</p>

<p>All we know of it is, from the singing of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
chorus; and that too is so uncertain, that in some of their plays we have
reason to conjecture they sung more than five times. Aristotle indeed
divides the integral parts of a play into four. First, the <i>Protasis</i>,
or entrance, which gives light only to the characters of the persons,
and proceeds very little into any part of the action. Secondly, the
<i>Epitasis</i>, or working up of the plot; where the play grows warmer, the
design or action of it is drawing on, and you see something promising
that it will come to pass. Thirdly, the <i>Catastasis</i>, called by the
Romans, <i>Status</i>, the height and full growth of the play: we may call it
properly the counter-turn, which destroys that expectation, embroils the
action in new difficulties, and leaves you far distant from that hope
in which it found you; as you may have observed in a violent stream,
resisted by a narrow passage,&mdash;it runs round to an eddy, and carries
back the waters with more swiftness than it brought them on. Lastly, the
<i>Catastrophe</i>, which the Grecians called λυσις,
the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le denouement</i>, and we the discovery, or unravelling of
the plot: there you see all things settling again upon their first
foundations, and, the obstacles which hindered the design or action of
the play once removed, it ends with that resemblance of truth and nature,
that the audience are satisfied with the conduct of it. Thus this great
man delivered to us the image of a play; and I must confess it is so
lively, that from thence much light has been derived to the forming it
more perfectly into acts and scenes: but what poet first limited to five
the number of the acts, I know not; only we see it so firmly established
in the time of Horace, that he gives it for a rule in comedy,&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Neu
brevior quinto, neu sit productior actu</i>. So that you see the Grecians
cannot be said to have consummated this art; writing rather by entrances,
than by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
acts, and having rather a general indigested notion
of a play, than knowing how, and where to bestow
the particular graces of it.</p>

<p>But since the Spaniards at this day allow but three acts, which they
call <i>Jornadas</i>, to a play, and the Italians in many of theirs follow
them, when I condemn the ancients, I declare it is not altogether because
they have not five acts to every play, but because they have not confined
themselves to one certain number: it is building an house without a
model; and when they succeeded in such undertakings, they ought to have
sacrificed to Fortune, not to the Muses.</p>

<p>Next, for the plot, which Aristotle called τὸ μυθὸς,
and often των πραγμάτων συ΄νθεσις, and from him the
Romans <i>Fabula</i>, it has already been judiciously observed
by a late writer, that in their tragedies it was only some tale derived
from Thebes or Troy, or at least something that happened in those two
ages; which was worn so thread-bare by the pens of all the epic poets,
and even by tradition itself of the talkative Greeklings, (as Ben Jonson
calls them,) that before it came upon the stage, it was already known to
all the audience; and the people, so soon as ever they heard the name of
&OElig;dipus, knew as well as the poet, that he had killed his father by
a mistake, and committed incest with his mother, before the play; that
they were now to hear of a great plague, an oracle, and the ghost of
Laius: so that they sate with a yawning kind of expectation, till he was
to come with his eyes pulled out, and speak a hundred or more verses in
a tragic tone, in complaint of his misfortunes. But one &OElig;dipus,
Hercules, or Medea, had been tolerable; poor people, they escaped not so
good cheap; they had still the <i>chapon bouillé</i> set before them, till
their appetites were cloyed with the same dish, and, the novelty being
gone, the pleasure vanished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
so that one main end of Dramatic Poesy in its definition,
which was to cause delight, was of consequence
destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>In their comedies, the Romans generally borrowed their plots from the
Greek poets; and theirs was commonly a little girl stolen or wandered
from her parents, brought back unknown to the city, there got with child
by some lewd young fellow, who, by the help of his servant, cheats his
father; and when her time comes, to cry&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Juno Lucina, fer opem</i>,
one or other sees a little box or cabinet which was carried away with
her, and so discovers her to her friends, if some god do not prevent it,
by coming down in a machine, and taking the thanks of it to himself.</p>

<p>By the plot you may guess much of the characters of the persons.
An old father, who would willingly, before he dies, see his son well
married; his debauched son, kind in his nature to his mistress, but
miserably in want of money; a servant or slave, who has so much wit to
strike in with him, and help to dupe his father; a braggadocio captain,
a parasite, and a lady of pleasure.</p>

<p>As for the poor honest maid, on whom the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
is built, and who ought to be one of the principal actors in the play,
she is commonly a mute in it: she has the breeding of the old Elizabeth
way, which was for maids to be seen, and not to be heard; and it is
enough you know she is willing to be married, when the fifth act requires
it.</p>

<p>These are plots built after the Italian mode of houses,&mdash;you see
through them all at once: the characters are indeed the imitations of
nature, but so narrow, as if they had imitated only an eye or an hand,
and did not dare to venture on the lines of a face, or the proportion of
a body.</p>

<p>But in how straight a compass soever they have bounded their plots and
characters, we will pass it by, if they have regularly pursued them, and
perfectly observed those three unities of time, place, and action; the
knowledge of which you say is derived to us from them. But, in the first
place, give me leave to tell you, that the unity of place, however it
might be practised by them, was never any of their rules: we neither find
it in Aristotle, Horace, or any who have written of it, till in our age
the French poets first made it a precept of the stage. The unity of time,
even Terence himself, who was the best and most regular of them, has
neglected: his "<cite>Heautontimorumenos</cite>," or Self-punisher, takes up visibly
two days, says Scaliger; the two first acts concluding the first day, the
three last the day ensuing; and Euripides, in tying himself to one day,
has committed an absurdity never to be forgiven him; for in one of his
tragedies he has made Theseus go from Athens to Thebes, which was about
forty English miles, under the walls of it to give battle, and appear
victorious in the next act; and yet, from the time of his departure to
the return of the Nuntius, who gives the relation of his victory, Æthra
and the Chorus have but thirty-six verses; which is not for every mile a
verse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>The like error is as evident in Terence his "Eunuch," when Laches, the
old man, enters by mistake into the house of Thais; where, betwixt his
exit, and the entrance of Pythias, who comes to give ample relation of
the disorders he has raised within, Parmeno, who was left upon the stage,
has not above five lines to speak. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C'est bien
employer un temps si court</i>, says the French poet, who furnished me with
one of the observations: and almost all their tragedies will afford us
examples of the like nature.</p>

<p>It is true, they have kept the continuity, or, as you called it,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaison des Scenes</i>, somewhat better: two do not perpetually come in
together, talk, and go out together; and other two succeed them, and
do the same throughout the act, which the English call by the name of
single scenes; but the reason is, because they have seldom above two or
three scenes, properly so called, in every act; for it is to be accounted
a new scene, not only every time the stage is empty, but every person
who enters, though to others, makes it so; because he introduces a new
business. Now the plots of their plays being narrow, and the persons
few, one of their acts was written in a less compass than one of our
well-wrought scenes; and yet they are often deficient even in this. To
go no farther than Terence, you find in the "Eunuch," Antipho entering
single in the midst of the third act, after Chremes and Pythias were
gone off: in the same play you have likewise Dorias beginning the fourth
act alone; and after she has made a relation of what was done at the
Soldier's entertainment, (which by the way was very inartificial, because
she was presumed to speak directly to the audience, and to acquaint
them with what was necessary to be known, but yet should have been so
contrived by the poet, as to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
told by persons of the drama to one another, and so by them to have
come to the knowledge of the people,) she quits the stage, and Phædria
enters next, alone likewise: he also gives you an account of himself,
and of his returning from the country, in monologue; to which unnatural
way of narration Terence is subject in all his plays. In his "Adelphi,
or Brothers," Syrus and Demea enter after the scene was broken by the
departure of Sostrata, Geta, and Canthara; and indeed you can scarce look
into any of his comedies, where you will not presently discover the same
interruption.</p>

<p>But as they have failed both in laying of their plots, and in the
management, swerving from the rules of their own art, by misrepresenting
nature to us, in which they have ill satisfied one intention of a play,
which was delight; so in the instructive part they have erred worse:
instead of punishing vice, and rewarding virtue, they have often shewn
a prosperous wickedness, and an unhappy piety: they have set before us
a bloody image of revenge in Medea, and given her dragons to convey
her safe from punishment. A Priam and Astyanax murdered, and Cassandra
ravished, and the lust and murder ending in the victory of him who acted
them. In short, there is no indecorum in any of our modern plays, which,
if I would excuse, I could not shadow with some authority from the
ancients.</p>

<p>And one farther note of them let me leave you: tragedies and comedies
were not writ then as they are now, promiscuously, by the same person;
but he who found his genius bending to the one, never attempted the
other way. This is so plain, that I need not instance to you, that
Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, never any of them writ a tragedy;
Æschylus, Euripides, Sophocles, and Seneca, never meddled with comedy:
the sock and buskin were not worn by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
same poet. Having then so much care to excel in one kind, very little is
to be pardoned them, if they miscarried in it; and this would lead me
to the consideration of their wit, had not Crites given me sufficient
warning not to be too bold in my judgment of it; because, the languages
being dead, and many of the customs and little accidents on which it
depended, lost to us, we are not competent judges of it. But though I
grant, that here and there we may miss the application of a proverb or a
custom, yet a thing well said will be wit in all languages; and though
it may lose something in the translation, yet to him who reads it in the
original, 'tis still the same; he has an idea of its excellency, though
it cannot pass from his mind into any other expression or words than
those in which he finds it. When Phædria in the "Eunuch" had a command
from his mistress to be absent two days, and encouraging himself to go
through with it, said, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tandem ego non illâ caream, si sit opus, vel
totum triduum?</i> Parmeno, to mock the softness of his master, lifting up
his hands and eyes, cries out, as it were in admiration, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hui! universum
triduum!</i> the elegancy of which <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">universum</i>, though it cannot be rendered
in our language, yet leaves an impression on our souls. But this happens
seldom in him; in Plautus oftener, who is infinitely too bold in his
metaphors and coining words, out of which many times his wit is nothing;
which questionless was one reason why Horace falls upon him so severely
in those verses:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sed proavi nostri Plautinos et numeros, et</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Laudavere sales, nimium patienter utrumque,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ne dicam stolide</i>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>For Horace himself was cautious to obtrude a new
word on his readers, and makes custom and common
use the best measure of receiving it into writings:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Multa renascentur quæ nunc [jam] cecidere, cadentque</i></div>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quem penes arbitrium est, et jus, et norma loquendi</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The not observing this rule is that which the
world has blamed in our satyrist, Cleiveland; to express
a thing hard and unnaturally, is his new way
of elocution. It is true, no poet but may sometimes
use a catachresis; Virgil does it,&mdash;</p>

<p>calling the court of Jupiter by the name of Augustus

more bold, where he says, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et longas visent Capitolia
pompas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But to do this always, and never be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
to write a line without it, though it may be admired by some few pedants,
will not pass upon those who know that wit is best conveyed to us in
the most easy language; and is most to be admired when a great thought
comes dressed in words so commonly received, that it is understood by the
meanest apprehensions, as the best meat is the most easily digested. But
we cannot read a verse of Cleiveland's without making a face at it, as if
every word were a pill to swallow: He gives us many times a hard nut to
break our teeth, without a kernel for our pains. So that there is this
difference betwixt his satires and Doctor Donne's, that the one gives us
deep thoughts in common language, though rough cadence; the other gives
us common thoughts in abstruse words. It is true, in some places his wit
is independent of his words, as in that of the rebel Scot:</p>

<div class="container">

<p>You see the last line is highly metaphorical, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
it is so soft and gentle, that it does not shock us as
we read it.</p>

<p>But, to return from whence I have digressed, to the consideration of
the ancients' writing, and their wit; of which, by this time, you will
grant us in some measure to be fit judges. Though I see many excellent
thoughts in Seneca, yet he, of them who had a genius most proper for the
stage, was Ovid; he had a way of writing so fit to stir up a pleasing
admiration and concernment, which are the objects of a tragedy, and to
shew the various movements of a soul combating betwixt two different
passions, that had he lived in our age, or in his own could have writ
with our advantages, no man but must have yielded to him; and therefore
I am confident the "Medea" is none of his; for though I esteem it for
the gravity and sententiousness of it, which he himself concludes to be
suitable to a tragedy,&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Omne genus scripti gravitate Trag&oelig;dia
vincit</i>,&mdash;yet it moves not my soul enough to judge that he, who in
the epic way wrote things so near the drama, as the story of Myrrha, of
Caunus and Biblis, and the rest, should stir up no more concernment where
he most endeavoured it.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The master-piece of Seneca I
hold to be that scene in the "Troades," where Ulysses is seeking for
Astyanax to kill him: there you see the tenderness of a mother, so
represented in Andromache, that it raises compassion to a high degree
in the reader, and bears the nearest resemblance of any thing in the
tragedies of the ancients, to the excellent scenes of passion in
Shakespeare, or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Fletcher.&mdash;For love-scenes you will find few among them; their
tragic poets dealt not with that soft passion, but with lust, cruelty,
revenge, ambition, and those bloody actions they produced; which were
more capable of raising horror than compassion in an audience: leaving
love untouched, whose gentleness would have tempered them, which is
the most frequent of all the passions, and which, being the private
concernment of every person, is soothed by viewing its own image in a
public entertainment.</p>

<p>Among their comedies, we find a scene or two of tenderness, and that
where you would least expect it, in Plautus; but to speak generally,
their lovers say little, when they see each other, but <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">anima mea,
vita mea</i>; ζωὴ και ψυχῆ, as the women in Juvenal's
time used to cry out in the fury of their kindness. Any sudden gust of
passion (as an ecstasy of love in an unexpected meeting) cannot better
be expressed than in a word, and a sigh, breaking one another. Nature is
dumb on such occasions; and to make her speak, would be to represent her
unlike herself. But there are a thousand other concernments of lovers,
as jealousies, complaints, contrivances, and the like, where not to open
their minds at large to each other, were to be wanting to their own love,
and to the expectation of the audience; who watch the movements of their
minds, as much as the changes of their fortunes. For the imagining of
the first is properly the work of a poet; the latter he borrows from the
historian.</p>

<p>Eugenius was proceeding in that part of his discourse, when Crites
interrupted him. I see, said he, Eugenius and I are never like to have
this question decided betwixt us; for he maintains, the moderns have
acquired a new perfection in writing, I can only grant they have altered
the mode of it, Homer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
described his heroes men of great appetites, lovers of beef broiled upon
the coals, and good fellows; contrary to the practice of the French
romances, whose heroes neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, for love.
Virgil makes Æneas a bold avower of his own virtues:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sum pius Æneas famâ super æthera notus</i>;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which, in the civility of our poets, is the character
of a fanfaron, or Hector: for with us the knight
takes occasion to walk out, or sleep, to avoid the
vanity of telling his own story, which the trusty
squire is ever to perform for him. So in their love-scenes,
of which Eugenius spoke last, the ancients
were more hearty, we more talkative: they writ
love as it was then the mode to make it; and I will
grant this much to Eugenius, that perhaps one of
their poets, had he lived in our age,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

<p>as Horace says of Lucilius, he had altered many things; not that they
were not natural before, but that he might accommodate himself to the
age in which he lived. Yet in the mean time we are not to conclude any
thing rashly against those great men, but preserve to them the dignity of

Libitina sacravit</i>,&mdash;part of which we expect may be
paid to us in future times.</p>

<p>This moderation of Crites, as it was pleasing to all the company, so
it put an end to that dispute; which Eugenius, who seemed to have the
better of the argument, would urge no farther. But Lisideius, after he
had acknowledged himself of Eugenius his opinion concerning the ancients,
yet told him, he had forborne, till his discourse were ended, to ask him,
why he preferred the English plays above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
those of other nations? and whether we ought not to submit our stage to
the exactness of our next neighbours?</p>

<p>Though, said Eugenius, I am at all times ready to defend the honour
of my country against the French, and to maintain, we are as well able
to vanquish them with our pens, as our ancestors have been with their
swords; yet, if you please, added he, looking upon Neander, I will commit
this cause to my friend's management; his opinion of our plays is the
same with mine: and besides, there is no reason, that Crites and I, who
have now left the stage, should re-enter so suddenly upon it; which is
against the laws of comedy.</p>

<p>If the question had been stated, replied Lisideius, who had writ
best, the French or English, forty years ago, I should have been of your
opinion, and adjudged the honour to our own nation; but since that time,
(said he, turning towards Neander,) we have been so long together bad
Englishmen, that we had not leisure to be good poets. Beaumont, Fletcher,
and Jonson, (who were only capable of bringing us to that degree of
perfection which we have,) were just then leaving the world; as if in
an age of so much horror, wit, and those milder studies of humanity,
had no farther business among us. But the muses, who ever follow peace,
went to plant in another country: it was then that the great Cardinal
of Richelieu began to take them into his protection; and that, by his
encouragement, Corneille, and some other Frenchmen, reformed their
theatre, which before was as much below ours, as it now surpasses it
and the rest of Europe. But because Crites, in his discourse for the
ancients, has prevented me, by observing many rules of the stage, which
the moderns have borrowed from them, I shall only, in short, demand of
you, whether you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
are not convinced that of all nations the French have best observed them?
In the unity of time you find them so scrupulous, that it yet remains a
dispute among their poets, whether the artificial day of twelve hours,
more or less, be not meant by Aristotle, rather than the natural one of
twenty-four; and consequently, whether all plays ought not to be reduced
into that compass. This I can testify, that in all their dramas writ
within these last twenty years and upwards, I have not observed any that
have extended the time to thirty hours. In the unity of place they are
full as scrupulous; for many of their critics limit it to that very spot
of ground where the play is supposed to begin; none of them exceed the
compass of the same town or city.</p>

<p>The unity of action in all their plays is yet more conspicuous; for
they do not burden them with under-plots, as the English do: which is
the reason why many scenes of our tragi-comedies carry on a design that
is nothing of kin to the main plot; and that we see two distinct webs
in a play, like those in ill-wrought stuffs; and two actions, that is,
two plays, carried on together, to the confounding of the audience; who,
before they are warm in their concernments for one part, are diverted to
another; and by that means espouse the interest of neither. From hence
likewise it arises, that the one half of our actors are not known to the
other. They keep their distances, as if they were Montagues and Capulets,
and seldom begin an acquaintance till the last scene of the fifth act,
when they are all to meet upon the stage. There is no theatre in the
world has any thing so absurd as the English tragi-comedy; it is a drama
of our own invention, and the fashion of it is enough to proclaim it so;
here a course of mirth, there another of sadness and passion, and a third
of honour and a duel: thus, in two hours and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
we run through all the fits of Bedlam. The French affords you as much
variety on the same day, but they do it not so unseasonably, or
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal à propos</i>, as we: our poets present you the
play and the farce together; and our stages still retain somewhat of the
original civility of the Red Bull:<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The end of tragedies or serious plays, says Aristotle, is to beget
admiration, compassion, or concernment; but are not mirth and compassion
things incompatible? and is it not evident, that the poet must of
necessity destroy the former by intermingling of the latter? that is, he
must ruin the sole end and object of his tragedy, to introduce somewhat
that is forced into it, and is not of the body of it. Would you not think
that physician mad, who, having prescribed a purge, should immediately
order you to take restringents?</p>

<p>But to leave our plays, and return to theirs. I have noted one great
advantage they have had in the plotting of their tragedies; that is,
they are always grounded upon some known history: according to that
of Horace, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex noto fictum carmen sequar</i>; and in that they have so
imitated the ancients, that they have surpassed them. For the ancients,
as was observed before, took for the foundation of their plays some
poetical fiction, such as under that consideration could move but little
concernment in the audience, because they already knew the event of it.
But the French goes farther:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet,</i></div>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>He so interweaves truth with probable fiction, that he puts a pleasing
fallacy upon us, mends the intrigues of fate, and dispenses with the
severity of history, to reward that virtue which has been rendered
to us there unfortunate. Sometimes the story has left the success so
doubtful, that the writer is free, by the privilege of a poet, to take
that which of two or more relations will best suit with his design: as
for example, in the death of Cyrus, whom Justin and some others report
to have perished in the Scythian war, but Xenophon affirms to have died
in his bed of extreme old age. Nay more, when the event is past dispute,
even then we are willing to be deceived, and the poet, if he contrives
it with appearance of truth, has all the audience of his party; at least
during the time his play is acting: so naturally we are kind to virtue,
when our own interest is not in question, that we take it up as the
general concernment of mankind. On the other side, if you consider the
historical plays of Shakespeare, they are rather so many chronicles of
kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, cramped into
a representation of two hours and a half; which is not to imitate or
paint nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little;
to look upon her through the wrong end of a perspective, and receive her
images not only much less, but infinitely more imperfect than the life:
this, instead of making a play delightful, renders it ridiculous:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the spirit of man cannot be satisfied but with
truth, or at least verisimility; and a poem is to contain,
if not τὰ ἐτυμα, yet ἐτύμοισιν ὁμοῖα, as one of the
Greek poets has expressed it.</p>

<p>Another thing in which the French differ from
us and from the Spaniards, is, that they do not embarrass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
or cumber themselves with too much plot; they only represent so much of
a story as will constitute one whole and great action sufficient for a
play: we, who undertake more, do but multiply adventures; which, not
being produced from one another, as effects from causes, but barely
following, constitute many actions in the drama, and consequently make it
many plays.</p>

<p>But by pursuing closely one argument, which is not cloyed with many
turns, the French have gained more liberty for verse, in which they
write: they have leisure to dwell on a subject which deserves it; and
to represent the passions, (which we have acknowledged to be the poet's
work,) without being hurried from one thing to another, as we are in the
plays of Calderon, which we have seen lately upon our theatres, under the
name of Spanish plots. I have taken notice but of one tragedy of ours,
whose plot has that uniformity and unity of design in it, which I have
commended in the French; and that is "Rollo,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
or rather, under the name of Rollo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
the story of Bassianus and Geta in Herodian: there indeed the plot is
neither large nor intricate, but just enough to fill the minds of the
audience, not to cloy them. Besides, you see it founded upon the truth
of history,&mdash;only the time of the action is not reduceable to the
strictness of the rules; and you see in some places a little farce
mingled, which is below the dignity of the other parts; and in this all
our poets are extremely peccant: even Ben Jonson himself, in "Sejanus"
and "Catiline," has given us this olio of a play, this unnatural mixture
of comedy and tragedy, which to me sounds just as ridiculously as the
history of David with the merry humours of Goliah. In "Sejanus" you
may take notice of the scene betwixt Livia and the physician, which is
a pleasant satire upon the artificial helps of beauty: in "Catiline"
you may see the parliament of women; the little envies of them to one
another; and all that passes betwixt Curio and Fulvia: scenes admirable
in their kind, but of an ill mingle with the rest.</p>

<p>But I return again to the French writers, who, as I have said, do not
burden themselves too much with plot, which has been reproached to them
by an ingenious person of our nation<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> as a fault; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>he says, they commonly make but one person considerable
in a play; they dwell on him, and his concernments, while the rest of
the persons are only subservient to set him off. If he intends this
by it,&mdash;that there is one person in the play who is of greater
dignity than the rest, he must tax, not only theirs, but those of the
ancients, and, which he would be loth to do, the best of ours; for it is
impossible but that one person must be more conspicuous in it than any
other, and consequently the greatest share in the action must devolve
on him. We see it so in the management of all affairs; even in the most
equal aristocracy, the balance cannot be so justly poised, but some one
will be superior to the rest, either in parts, fortune, interest, or the
consideration of some glorious exploit; which will reduce the greatest
part of business into his hands.</p>

<p>But, if he would have us to imagine, that in exalting one character
the rest of them are neglected, and that all of them have not some share
or other in the action of the play, I desire him to produce any of
Corneille's tragedies, wherein every person (like so many servants in a
well-governed family) has not some employment, and who is not necessary
to the carrying on of the plot, or at least to your understanding it.</p>

<p>There are indeed some protatic persons in the ancients, whom they make
use of in their plays, either to hear, or give the relation: but the
French avoid this with great address, making their narrations only to,
or by such, who are some way interested in the main design. And now I am
speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of relations, I cannot take a fitter opportunity to add this in favour
of the French, that they often use them with better judgment and more
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">á propos</i> than the English do. Not that I commend narrations in
general,&mdash;but there are two sorts of them; one, of those things
which are antecedent to the play, and are related to make the conduct
of it more clear to us; but it is a fault to chuse such subjects for
the stage as will force us on that rock, because we see they are seldom
listened to by the audience, and that is many times the ruin of the
play; for, being once let pass without attention, the audience can never
recover themselves to understand the plot; and indeed it is somewhat
unreasonable, that they should be put to so much trouble, as, that to
comprehend what passes in their sight, they must have recourse to what
was done, perhaps, ten or twenty years ago.</p>

<p>But there is another sort of relations, that is, of things happening
in the action of the play, and supposed to be done behind the scenes; and
this is many times both convenient and beautiful: for, by it the French
avoid the tumult to which we are subject in England, by representing
duels, battles, and the like; which renders our stage too like the
theatres where they fight prizes. For what is more ridiculous than to
represent an army with a drum and five men behind it; all which, the hero
of the other side is to drive in before him? or to see a duel fought, and
one slain with two or three thrusts of the foils, which we know are so
blunted, that we might give a man an hour to kill another in good earnest
with them?</p>

<p>I have observed, that in all our tragedies the audience cannot forbear
laughing when the actors are to die; it is the most comic part of the
whole play. All passions may be lively represented on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
the stage, if to the well-writing of them the actor supplies a good
commanded voice, and limbs that move easily, and without stiffness; but
there are many actions which can never be imitated to a just height:
dying especially is a thing which none but a Roman gladiator could
naturally perform on the stage, when he did not imitate, or represent,
but do it; and therefore it is better to omit the representation of
it.</p>

<p>The words of a good writer, which describe it lively, will make a
deeper impression of belief in us, than all the actor can insinuate into
us, when he seems to fall dead before us; as a poet in the description of
a beautiful garden, or a meadow, will please our imagination more than
the place itself can please our sight. When we see death represented, we
are convinced it is but fiction; but when we hear it related, our eyes
(the strongest witnesses) are wanting, which might have undeceived us;
and we are all willing to favour the slight when the poet does not too
grossly impose on us. They, therefore, who imagine these relations would
make no concernment in the audience, are deceived, by confounding them
with the other, which are of things antecedent to the play: those are
made often in cold blood, as I may say, to the audience; but these are
warmed with our concernments, which were before awakened in the play.
What the philosophers say of motion, that, when it is once begun, it
continues of itself, and will do so to eternity, without some stop put to
it, is clearly true on this occasion: the soul, being already moved with
the characters and fortunes of those imaginary persons, continues going
of its own accord; and we are no more weary to hear what becomes of them
when they are not on the stage, than we are to listen to the news of an
absent mistress. But it is objected, that if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
part of the play may be related, then why not all? I answer, some parts
of the action are more fit to be represented, some to be related.
Corneille says judiciously, that the poet is not obliged to expose to
view all particular actions which conduce to the principal: he ought
to select such of them to be seen, which will appear with the greatest
beauty, either by the magnificence of the show, or the vehemence of
passions which they produce, or some other charm which they have in them,
and let the rest arrive to the audience by narration. It is a great
mistake in us to believe the French present no part of the action on
the stage: every alteration or crossing of a design, every new-sprung
passion, and turn of it, is a part of the action, and much the noblest,
except we conceive nothing to be action till the players come to blows;
as if the painting of the hero's mind were not more properly the poet's
work, than the strength of his body. Nor does this any thing contradict
the opinion of Horace, where he tells us,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For he says immediately after,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Non tamen intus</i></div>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex oculis, quæ mox narret facundia præsens.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among which many he recounts some:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nec pueros coram populo Medea trucidet,</i></div>
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aut in avem Progne mutetur, Cadmus in anguem</i>, &amp;c.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is, those actions which by reason of their cruelty will cause
aversion in us, or by reason of their impossibility, unbelief, ought
either wholly to be avoided by a poet, or only delivered by narration. To
which we may have leave to add such as, to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
tumult, (as was before hinted,) or to reduce the plot into a more
reasonable compass of time, or for defect of beauty in them, are rather
to be related than presented to the eye. Examples of all these kinds are
frequent, not only among all the ancients, but in the best received of
our English poets. We find Ben Jonson using them in his "Magnetic Lady,"
where one comes out from dinner, and relates the quarrels and disorders
of it to save the undecent appearance of them on the stage, and to
abbreviate the story: and this in express imitation of Terence, who had
done the same before him in his "Eunuch," where Pythias makes the like
relation of what had happened within at the Soldier's entertainment. The
relations, likewise, of Sejanus's death, and the prodigies before it,
are remarkable; the one of which was hid from sight to avoid the horror
and tumult of the representation; the other, to shun the introducing
of things impossible to be believed. In that excellent play, "The King
and no King," Fletcher goes yet farther; for the whole unravelling of
the plot is done by narration in the fifth act, after the manner of the
ancients; and it moves great concernment in the audience, though it be
only a relation of what was done many years before the play. I could
multiply other instances, but these are sufficient to prove, that there
is no error in chusing a subject which requires this sort of narrations;
in the ill management of them, there may.</p>

<p>But I find I have been too long in this discourse, since the French
have many other excellencies not common to us; as that you never see any
of their plays end with a conversion, or simple change of will, which is
the ordinary way which our poets use to end theirs. It shews little art
in the conclusion of a dramatic poem, when they who have hindered the
felicity during the four acts, desist from it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the fifth, without some powerful cause to take them off their design; and
though I deny not but such reasons may be found, yet it is a path that
is cautiously to be trod, and the poet is to be sure he convinces the
audience, that the motive is strong enough.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
As for example, the conversion of the Usurer in "The Scornful Lady,"
seems to me a little forced; for, being an usurer, which implies a lover
of money to the highest degree of covetousness, (and such the poet has
represented him,) the account he gives for the sudden change is, that he
has been duped by the wild young fellow; which in reason might render him
more wary another time, and make him punish himself with harder fare and
coarser clothes to get up again what he had lost: but that he should look
on it as a judgment, and so repent, we may expect to hear in a sermon,
but I should never endure it in a play.</p>

<p>I pass by this; neither will I insist on the care they take, that no
person after his first entrance shall ever appear, but the business which
brings him upon the stage shall be evident; which rule, if observed, must
needs render all the events in the play more natural; for there you see
the probability of every accident, in the cause that produced it; and
that which appears chance in the play, will seem so reasonable to you,
that you will there find it almost necessary: so that in the exit of the
actor you have a clear account of his purpose and design in the next
entrance; (though, if the scene be well wrought, the event will commonly
deceive you;) for there is nothing so absurd, says Corneille, as for an
actor to leave the stage, only because he has no more to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>I should now speak of the beauty of their rhyme, and the just reason
I have to prefer that way of writing in tragedies before ours in
blank-verse; but because it is partly received by us, and therefore not
altogether peculiar to them, I will say no more of it in relation to
their plays. For our own, I doubt not but it will exceedingly beautify
them; and I can see but one reason why it should not generally obtain,
that is, because our poets write so ill in it. This indeed may prove a
more prevailing argument than all others which are used to destroy it,
and therefore I am only troubled when great and judicious poets, and
those who are acknowledged such, have writ or spoke against it: as for
others, they are to be answered by that one sentence of an ancient author:<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sed ut primo ad consequendos eos quos priores
ducimus, accendimur, ita ubi aut præteriri, aut æquari eos posse
desperavimus, studium cum spe senescit: quod, scilicet, assequi non
potest, sequi desinit;&mdash;pr&oelig;teritoque eo in quo eminere non
possumus, aliquid in quo nitamur, conquirimus</i>.</p>

<p>Lisideius concluded in this manner; and Neander, after a little pause,
thus answered him:</p>

<p>I shall grant Lisideius, without much dispute, a great part of what he
has urged against us; for I acknowledge, that the French contrive their
plots more regularly, and observe the laws of comedy, and decorum of
the stage, (to speak generally,) with more exactness than the English.
Farther, I deny not but he has taxed us justly in some irregularities
of ours, which he has mentioned; yet, after all, I am of opinion, that
neither our faults, nor their virtues, are considerable enough to place
them above us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>For the lively imitation of nature being in the definition of a play,
those which best fulfil that law, ought to be esteemed superior to the
others. 'Tis true, those beauties of the French poesy are such as will
raise perfection higher where it is, but are not sufficient to give it
where it is not: they are indeed the beauties of a statue, but not of a
man, because not animated with the soul of poesy, which is imitation of
humour and passions: and this Lisideius himself, or any other, however
biassed to their party, cannot but acknowledge, if he will either compare
the humours of our comedies, or the characters of our serious plays, with
theirs. He who will look upon theirs which have been written till these
last ten years, or thereabouts, will find it an hard matter to pick out
two or three passable humours amongst them. Corneille himself, their
arch-poet, what has he produced except "The Liar," and you know how it
was cried up in France; but when it came upon the English stage, though
well translated, and that part of Dorant acted<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
to so much advantage as I am confident it never received in its own
country, the most favourable to it would not put it in competition with
many of Fletcher's or Ben Jonson's. In the rest of Corneille's comedies
you have little humour; he tells you himself, his way is, first to shew
two lovers in good intelligence with each other; in the working up of the
play, to embroil them by some mistake, and in the latter end to clear it,
and reconcile them.</p>

<p>But of late years Moliere, the younger Corneille,
Quinault, and some others, have been imitating afar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
off the quick turns and graces of the English stage. They have mixed
their serious plays with mirth, like our tragi-comedies, since the death
of Cardinal Richelieu,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> which Lisideius, and many others, not
observing, have commended that in them for a virtue, which they
themselves no longer practise. Most of their new plays are, like some
of ours, derived from the Spanish novels. There is scarce one of them
without a veil, and a trusty Diego, who drolls much after the rate of the
"Adventures."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> But their
humours, if I may grace them with that name, are so thin sown, that never
above one of them comes up in any play. I dare take upon me to find more
variety of them in some one play of Ben Jonson's, than in all theirs
together: as he who has seen the "Alchemist," "The Silent Woman," or
"Bartholomew Fair," cannot but acknowledge with me.</p>

<p>I grant the French have performed what was possible on the ground-work
of the Spanish plays; what was pleasant before, they have made regular:
but there is not above one good play to be writ on all those plots; they
are too much alike to please often, which we need not the experience
of our own stage to justify. As for their new way of mingling mirth
with serious plot, I do not, with Lisideius, condemn the thing, though
I cannot approve their manner of doing it. He tells us, we cannot so
speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
recollect ourselves after a scene of great passion and concernment, as
to pass to another of mirth and humour, and to enjoy it with any relish:
but why should he imagine the soul of man more heavy than his senses?
Does not the eye pass from an unpleasant object to a pleasant, in a much
shorter time than is required to this? and does not the unpleasantness
of the first commend the beauty of the latter? The old rule of logic
might have convinced him, that contraries, when placed near, set off
each other. A continued gravity keeps the spirit too much bent; we must
refresh it sometimes, as we bait in a journey, that we may go on with
greater ease. A scene of mirth, mixed with tragedy, has the same effect
upon us which our music has betwixt the acts; which we find a relief to
us from the best plots and language of the stage, if the discourses have
been long. I must therefore have stronger arguments, ere I am convinced
that compassion and mirth in the same subject destroy each other; and in
the mean time, cannot but conclude, to the honour of our nation, that we
have invented, increased, and perfected, a more pleasant way of writing
for the stage, than was ever known to the ancients or moderns of any
nation, which is tragi-comedy.</p>

<p>And this leads me to wonder why Lisideius and many others should cry
up the barrenness of the French plots, above the variety and copiousness
of the English. Their plots are single, they carry on one design,
which is pushed forward by all the actors, every scene in the play
contributing and moving towards it. Our plays, besides the main design,
have under-plots, or by-concernments, of less considerable persons and
intrigues, which are carried on with the motion of the main plot: as they
say the orb of the fixed stars, and those of the planets, though they
have motions of their own, are whirled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
about by the motion of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primum mobile</i>, in which
they are contained. That similitude expresses much of the English stage;
for if contrary motions may be found in nature to agree; if a planet can
go east and west at the same time;&mdash;one way by virtue of his own
motion, the other by the force of the first mover;&mdash;it will not
be difficult to imagine how the under-plot, which is only different,
not contrary to the great design, may naturally be conducted along with
it.</p>

<p>Eugenius has already shewn us, from the confession of the French
poets, that the unity of action is sufficiently preserved, if all the
imperfect actions of the play are conducing to the main design; but when
those petty intrigues of a play are so ill ordered, that they have no
coherence with the other, I must grant that Lisideius has reason to tax
that want of due connection; for co-ordination in a play is as dangerous
and unnatural as in a state. In the mean time he must acknowledge,
our variety, if well ordered, will afford a greater pleasure to the
audience.</p>

<p>As for his other argument, that by pursuing one single theme they gain
an advantage to express and work up the passions, I wish any example he
could bring from them would make it good; for I confess their verses are
to me the coldest I have ever read. Neither, indeed, is it possible for
them, in the way they take, so to express passion, as that the effects of
it should appear in the concernment of an audience, their speeches being
so many declamations, which tire us with the length; so that instead of
persuading us to grieve for their imaginary heroes, we are concerned for
our own trouble, as we are in tedious visits of bad company; we are in
pain till they are gone. When the French stage came to be reformed by
Cardinal Richelieu, those long harangues were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
introduced, to comply with the gravity of a churchman. Look upon the
"Cinna" and the "Pompey;" they are not so properly to be called plays,
as long discourses of reason of state; and "Polieucte" in matters of
religion is as solemn as the long stops upon our organs. Since that time
it is grown into a custom, and their actors speak by the hour-glass, like
our parsons;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> nay, they account it the grace of
their parts, and think themselves disparaged by the poet, if they may
not twice or thrice in a play entertain the audience with a speech of
an hundred lines. I deny not but this may suit well enough with the
French; for as we, who are a more sullen people, come to be diverted at
our plays, so they, who are of an airy and gay temper, come thither to
make themselves more serious: and this I conceive to be one reason, why
comedies are more pleasing to us, and tragedies to them. But to speak
generally: it cannot be denied, that short speeches and replies are more
apt to move the passions, and beget concernment in us, than the other;
for it is unnatural for any one, in a gust of passion, to speak long
together; or for another, in the same condition, to suffer him without
interruption. Grief and passion are like floods raised in little brooks
by a sudden rain; they are quickly up, and if the concernment be poured
unexpectedly in upon us, it overflows us: But a long sober shower gives
them leisure to run out as they came in, without troubling the ordinary
current. As for comedy, repartee is one of its chiefest graces; the
greatest pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>of the audience is a chace of wit, kept up on both
sides, and swiftly managed. And this our forefathers, if not we, have
had in Fletcher's plays, to a much higher degree of perfection, than the
French poets can reasonably hope to reach.</p>

<p>There is another part of Lisideius's discourse, in which he has rather
excused our neighbours, than commended them; that is, for aiming only to
make one person considerable in their plays. It is very true what he has
urged, that one character in all plays, even without the poet's care,
will have advantage of all the others; and that the design of the whole
drama will chiefly depend on it. But this hinders not that there may be
more shining characters in the play: many persons of a second magnitude,
nay, some so very near, so almost equal to the first, that greatness may
be opposed to greatness, and all the persons be made considerable, not
only by their quality, but their action. It is evident, that the more
the persons are, the greater will be the variety of the plot. If then
the parts are managed so regularly, that the beauty of the whole be kept
entire, and that the variety become not a perplexed and confused mass of
accidents, you will find it infinitely pleasing to be led in a labyrinth
of design, where you see some of your way before you, yet discern not
the end till you arrive at it. And that all this is practicable, I can
produce for examples many of our English plays: As "The Maid's Tragedy,"
"The Alchemist," "The Silent Woman:" I was going to have named "The Fox,"
but that the unity of design seems not exactly observed in it; for there
appear two actions in the play; the first naturally ending with the
fourth act, the second forced from it in the fifth: which yet is the less
to be condemned in him, because the disguise of Volpone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
though it suited not with his character as a crafty or covetous person,
agreed well enough with that of a voluptuary;<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
and by it the poet gained the end at which he aimed, the punishment of
vice, and the reward of virtue, both which that disguise produced. So
that to judge equally of it, it was an excellent fifth act, but not so
naturally proceeding from the former.</p>

<p>But to leave this, and pass to the latter part of Lisideius's
discourse, which concerns relations, I must acknowledge with him, that
the French have reason to hide that part of the action which would
occasion too much tumult on the stage, and to chuse rather to have
it made known by narration to the audience. Farther, I think it very
convenient, for the reasons he has given, that all incredible actions
were removed; but, whether custom has so insinuated itself into our
countrymen, or nature has so formed them to fierceness, I know not; but
they will scarcely suffer combats and other objects of horror to be taken
from them. And indeed, the indecency of tumults is all which can be
objected against fighting: for why may not our imagination as well suffer
itself to be deluded with the probability of it, as with any other thing
in the play? For my part, I can with as great ease persuade myself, that
the blows are given in good earnest, as I can, that they who strike them
are kings or princes, or those persons which they represent. For objects
of incredibility,&mdash;I would be satisfied from Lisideius, whether
we have any so removed from all appearance of truth, as are those of
Corneille's "Andromede;" a play which has been frequented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the most of any he has writ. If the Perseus, or the son of an heathen
god, the Pegasus, and the Monster, were not capable to choke a strong
belief, let him blame any representation of ours hereafter. Those
indeed were objects of delight; yet the reason is the same as to the
probability; for he makes it not a ballet, or masque, but a play, which
is to resemble truth. But for death, that it ought not to be represented,
I have, besides the arguments alleged by Lisideius, the authority of
Ben Jonson, who has forborne it in his tragedies; for both the death of
Sejanus and Catiline are related; though, in the latter, I cannot but
observe one irregularity of that great poet; he has removed the scene
in the same act, from Rome to Catiline's army, and from thence again to
Rome; and besides, has allowed a very considerable time after Catiline's
speech, for the striking of the battle, and the return of Petreius, who
is to relate the event of it to the senate; which I should not animadvert
on him, who was otherwise a painful observer of τὸ πρεπὸν,
or the <em>decorum</em> of the stage, if he had not used extreme
severity in his judgment on the incomparable
Shakespeare for the same fault.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> To conclude on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
this subject of relations, if we are to be blamed for shewing too much of
the action, the French are as faulty for discovering too little of it; a
mean betwixt both should be observed by every judicious writer, so as the
audience may neither be left unsatisfied by not seeing what is beautiful,
or shocked by beholding what is either incredible or undecent.</p>

<p>I hope I have already proved in this discourse, that though we are not
altogether so punctual as the French, in observing the laws of comedy,
yet our errors are so few, and little, and those things wherein we excel
them so considerable, that we ought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
right to be preferred before them. But what will Lisideius say, if they
themselves acknowledge they are too strictly bounded by those laws, for
breaking which he has blamed the English? I will allege Corneille's
words, as I find them in the end of his Discourse of the three Unities:
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il est facile aux speculatifs d'estre severes</i>, &amp;c. "It is easy
for speculative persons to judge severely; but if they would produce to
public view ten or twelve pieces of this nature, they would perhaps give
more latitude to the rules than I have done, when, by experience, they
had known how much we are limited and constrained by them, and how many
beauties of the stage they banished from it." To illustrate a little what
he has said:&mdash;by their servile observations of the unities of time
and place, and integrity of scenes, they have brought on themselves that
dearth of plot, and narrowness of imagination, which may be observed in
all their plays. How many beautiful accidents might naturally happen
in two or three days, which cannot arrive with any probability in the
compass of twenty-four hours? There is time to be allowed also for
maturity of design, which amongst great and prudent persons, such as
are often represented in tragedy, cannot, with any likelihood of truth,
be brought to pass at so short a warning. Farther, by tying themselves
strictly to the unity of place, and unbroken scenes, they are forced many
times to omit some beauties which cannot be shewn where the act began;
but might, if the scene were interrupted, and the stage cleared for the
persons to enter in another place; and therefore the French poets are
often forced upon absurdities: for if the act begins in a chamber, all
the persons in the play must have some business or other to come thither,
or else they are not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
shewn that act; and sometimes their characters are very unfitting to
appear there: as suppose it were the king's bed-chamber, yet the meanest
man in the tragedy must come and dispatch his business there, rather
than in the lobby, or court-yard, (which is fitter for him,) for fear
the stage should be cleared, and the scenes broken. Many times they fall
by it into a greater inconvenience; for they keep their scenes unbroken,
and yet change the place; as in one of their newest plays, where the
act begins in the street. There a gentleman is to meet his friend; he
sees him with his man, coming out from his father's house; they talk
together, and the first goes out: the second, who is a lover, has made
an appointment with his mistress; she appears at the window, and then
we are to imagine the scene lies under it. This gentleman is called
away, and leaves his servant with his mistress: presently her father is
heard from within; the young lady is afraid the serving-man should be
discovered, and thrusts him into a place of safety, which is supposed to
be her closet. After this, the father enters to the daughter, and now the
scene is in a house: for he is seeking from one room to another for this
poor Philipin, or French Diego, who is heard from within, drolling and
breaking many a miserable conceit on the subject of his sad condition.
In this ridiculous manner the play goes forward, the stage being never
empty all the while: so that the street, the window, the two houses, and
the closet, are made to walk about, and the persons to stand still. Now,
what, I beseech you, is more easy than to write a regular French play,
or more difficult than to write an irregular English one, like those of
Fletcher, or of Shakespeare?</p>

<p>If they content themselves, as Corneille did,
with some flat design, which, like an ill riddle, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
found out ere it be half proposed, such plots we can make every way
regular as easily as they; but whenever they endeavour to rise to any
quick turns and counter-turns of plot, as some of them have attempted,
since Corneille's plays have been less in vogue, you see they write as
irregularly as we, though they cover it more speciously. Hence the reason
is perspicuous, why no French plays, when translated, have, or ever can
succeed on the English stage. For, if you consider the plots, our own
are fuller of variety; if the writing, ours are more quick and fuller
of spirit; and therefore 'tis a strange mistake in those who decry the
way of writing plays in verse, as if the English therein imitated the
French. We have borrowed nothing from them; our plots are weaved in
English looms: we endeavour therein to follow the variety and greatness
of characters, which are derived to us from Shakespeare and Fletcher; the
copiousness and well-knitting of the intrigues we have from Jonson; and
for the verse itself we have English precedents of elder date than any of
Corneille's plays. Not to name our old comedies before Shakespeare, which
were all writ in verse of six feet, or Alexandrines, such as the French
now use,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> I can shew in Shakespeare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
many scenes of rhyme together, and the like in Ben Jonson's tragedies: in
"Catiline" and "Sejanus" sometimes thirty or forty lines,&mdash;I mean
besides the chorus, or the monologues; which, by the way, shewed Ben no
enemy to this way of writing, especially if you read his "Sad Shepherd,"
which goes sometimes on rhyme, sometimes on blank verse, like an horse
who eases himself on trot and amble. You find him likewise commending
Fletcher's pastoral of "The Faithful Shepherdess," which is for the most
part rhyme, though not refined to that purity to which it hath since
been brought. And these examples are enough to clear us from a servile
imitation of the French.</p>

<p>But to return whence I have digressed: I dare boldly affirm these two
things of the English drama;&mdash;First, that we have many plays of
ours as regular as any of theirs, and which, besides, have more variety
of plot and characters; and, secondly, that in most of the irregular
plays of Shakespeare or Fletcher, (for Ben Jonson's are for the most
part regular,) there is a more masculine fancy, and greater spirit in
the writing, than there is in any of the French. I could produce even
in Shakespeare's and Fletcher's works, some plays which are almost
exactly formed; as the "Merry Wives of Windsor," and "The Scornful Lady:"
but, because (generally speaking) Shakespeare, who writ first, did not
perfectly observe the laws of comedy, and Fletcher, who came nearer to
perfection, yet through carelessness made many faults; I will take the
pattern of a perfect play from Ben Jonson, who was a careful and learned
observer of the dramatic laws, and from all his comedies I shall select
"The Silent Woman;" of which I will make a short examen, according to
those rules which the French observe.</p>

<p>As Neander was beginning to examine "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Silent Woman," Eugenius, earnestly regarding him; I beseech you, Neander,
said he, gratify the company, and me in particular, so far as, before
you speak of the play, to give us a character of the author; and tell us
frankly your opinion, whether you do not think all writers, both French
and English, ought to give place to him?</p>

<p>I fear, replied Neander, that, in obeying your commands, I shall
draw some envy on myself. Besides, in performing them, it will be first
necessary to speak somewhat of Shakespeare and Fletcher, his rivals in
poesy; and one of them, in my opinion, at least his equal, perhaps his
superior.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>To begin then with Shakespeare. He was the man who of all modern, and
perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul. All
the images of nature were still present to him, and he drew them not
laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than
see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning,
give him the greater commendation: he was naturally learned; he needed
not the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards, and found
her there. I cannot say he is every where alike; were he so, I should do
him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind. He is many times
flat, insipid; his comic wit degenerating into clenches, his serious
swelling into bombast. But he is always great, when some great occasion
is presented to him: no man can say, he ever had a fit subject for his
wit, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
not then raise himself as high above the rest of poets,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi</i>.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The consideration of this made Mr Hales of Eton<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
say, that there was no subject of which any poet ever writ, but he would
produce it much better done in Shakespeare; and however others are now
generally preferred before him, yet the age wherein he lived, which had
contemporaries with him, Fletcher and Jonson, never equalled them to him
in their esteem: and in the last king's court, when Ben's reputation
was at highest, Sir John Suckling, and with him the greater part of the
courtiers, set our Shakespeare far above him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>Beaumont and Fletcher, of whom I am next to speak, had, with the
advantage of Shakespeare's wit, which was their precedent, great natural
gifts, improved by study; Beaumont especially being so accurate a judge
of plays, that Ben Jonson, while he lived, submitted all his writings
to his censure, and 'tis thought, used his judgment in correcting,
if not contriving, all his plots. What value he had for him, appears
by the verses he writ to him; and therefore I need speak no farther
of it. The first play that brought Fletcher and him in esteem, was
their "Philaster;" for before that, they had written two or three very
unsuccessfully: as the like is reported of Ben Jonson, before he writ
"Every Man in his Humour." Their plots were generally more regular than
Shakespeare's, especially those which were made before Beaumont's death;
and they understood and imitated the conversation of gentlemen much
better; whose wild debaucheries, and quickness of wit in repartees, no
poet before them could paint as they have done. Humour,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> which
Ben Jonson derived from particular persons, they made it not their
business to describe: they represented all the passions very lively,
but above all, love. I am apt to believe the English language in them
arrived to its highest perfection; what words have since been taken in,
are rather superfluous than ornamental. Their plays are now the most
pleasant and frequent entertainments of the stage; two of theirs being
acted through the year for one of Shakespeare's or Jonson's: the reason
is, because there is a certain gaiety in their comedies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
pathos in their more serious plays, which suits generally with all men's
humours. Shakespeare's language is likewise a little obsolete, and Ben
Jonson's wit comes short of theirs.</p>

<p>As for Jonson, to whose character I am now arrived, if we look upon
him while he was himself, (for his last plays were but his dotages,) I
think him the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever
had. He was a most severe judge of himself, as well as others. One cannot
say he wanted wit, but rather that he was frugal of it. In his works
you find little to retrench or alter. Wit and language, and humour also
in some measure, we had before him; but something of art was wanting
to the drama, till he came. He managed his strength to more advantage
than any who preceded him. You seldom find him making love in any of his
scenes, or endeavouring to move the passions; his genius was too sullen
and saturnine to do it gracefully, especially when he knew he came after
those who had performed both to such an height. Humour was his proper
sphere; and in that he delighted most to represent mechanic people. He
was deeply conversant in the ancients, both Greek and Latin, and he
borrowed boldly from them: there is scarce a poet or historian among the
Roman authors of those times, whom he has not translated in "Sejanus" and
"Catiline." But he has done his robberies so openly, that one may see
he fears not to be taxed by any law. He invades authors like a monarch;
and what would be theft in other poets, is only victory in him. With the
spoils of these writers he so represents old Rome to us, in its rites,
ceremonies, and customs, that if one of their poets had written either of
his tragedies, we had seen less of it than in him. If there was any fault
in his language, it was, that he weaved it too closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
and laboriously, in his comedies especially: perhaps too, he did a little
too much Romanize our tongue, leaving the words which he translated
almost as much Latin as he found them: wherein, though he learnedly
followed their language, he did not enough comply with the idiom of ours.
If I would compare him with Shakespeare, I must acknowledge him the more
correct poet, but Shakespeare the greater wit.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Shakespeare was the Homer, or father of our dramatic poets; Jonson was
the Virgil, the pattern of elaborate writing; I admire him, but I love
Shakespeare. To conclude of him; as he has given us the most correct
plays, so in the precepts which he has laid down in his "Discoveries,"
we have as many and profitable rules for perfecting the stage, as any
wherewith the French can furnish us.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken of the author, I proceed to the examination of his
comedy, "The Silent Woman."</p>


<p class="p2"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Examen of "The Silent Woman."</i></p>

<p>To begin first with the length of the action; it is so far from
exceeding the compass of a natural day, that it takes not up an
artificial one. It is all included in the limits of three hours and an
half, which is no more than is required for the presentment on the stage:
a beauty perhaps not much observed; if it had, we should not have looked
on the Spanish translation of "Five Hours" with so much wonder. The scene
of it is laid in London; the latitude of place is almost as little as you
can imagine; for it lies all within the compass of two houses, and after
the first act, in one. The continuity of scenes is observed more than in
any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
our plays, except his own "Fox" and "Alchemist." They are not broken
above twice, or thrice at most, in the whole comedy; and in the two best
of Corneille's plays, the "Cid" and "Cinna," they are interrupted once.
The action of the play is entirely one; the end or aim of which is the
settling Morose's estate on Dauphine. The intrigue of it is the greatest
and most noble of any pure unmixed comedy in any language: you see in it
many persons of various characters and humours, and all delightful. As
first, Morose, or an old man, to whom all noise, but his own talking,
is offensive. Some, who would be thought critics, say this humour of
his is forced: but to remove that objection, we may consider him first
to be naturally of a delicate hearing, as many are to whom all sharp
sounds are unpleasant; and secondly, we may attribute much of it to the
peevishness of his age, or the wayward authority of an old man in his
own house, where he may make himself obeyed; and to this the poet seems
to allude in his name Morose. Beside this, I am assured from divers
persons, that Ben Jonson was actually acquainted with such a man, one
altogether as ridiculous as he is here represented. Others say, it is
not enough to find one man of such an humour; it must be common to more,
and the more common the more natural. To prove this, they instance in
the best of comical characters, Falstaff. There are many men resembling
him; old, fat, merry, cowardly, drunken, amorous, vain, and lying. But
to convince these people, I need but tell them, that humour is the
ridiculous extravagance of conversation, wherein one man differs from all
others. If then it be common, or communicated to many, how differs it
from other men's? or what indeed causes it to be ridiculous so much as
the singularity of it? As for Falstaff, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
not properly one humour, but a miscellany of humours or images, drawn
from so many several men: that wherein he is singular is his wit, or
those things he says, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pr&oelig;ter expectatum</i>, unexpected by the
audience; his quick evasions, when you imagine him surprised, which, as
they are extremely diverting of themselves, so receive a great addition
from his person; for the very sight of such an unwieldy old debauched
fellow is a comedy alone. And here, having a place so proper for it, I
cannot but enlarge somewhat upon this subject of humour into which I am
fallen. The ancients had little of it in their comedies; for the
τὸ γελοῖον of the old comedy,
of which Aristophanes was chief, was not so much to imitate a man, as to
make the people laugh at some odd conceit, which had commonly somewhat of
unnatural or obscene in it. Thus, when you see Socrates brought upon the
stage, you are not to imagine him made ridiculous by the imitation of his
actions, but rather by making him perform something very unlike himself:
something so childish and absurd, as by comparing it with the gravity of
the true Socrates, makes a ridiculous object for the spectators. In their
new comedy which succeeded, the poets sought indeed to express the
ἦθος, as in their tragedies the πάθος
of mankind. But this ἦθος contained only the
general characters of men and manners; as old men, lovers, serving-men,
courtezans, parasites, and such other persons as we see in their
comedies; all which they made alike: that is, one old man or father, one
lover, one courtezan, so like another, as if the first of them had begot
the rest of every sort: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex homine hunc natum dicas</i>. The same custom
they observed likewise in their tragedies. As for the French, though they
have the word <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">humeur</i> among them, yet they have small use of it in their
comedies, or farces; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
being but ill imitations of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ridiculum</i>, or that
which stirred up laughter in the old comedy. But among the English 'tis
otherwise: where, by humour is meant some extravagant habit, passion,
or affection, particular (as I said before) to some one person, by the
oddness of which, he is immediately distinguished from the rest of men;
which being lively and naturally represented, most frequently begets that
malicious pleasure in the audience which is testified by laughter; as all
things which are deviations from customs are ever the aptest to produce
it: though by the way this laughter is only accidental, as the person
represented is fantastic or bizarre; but pleasure is essential to it,
as the imitation of what is natural. The description of these humours,
drawn from the knowledge and observation of particular persons, was the
peculiar genius and talent of Ben Jonson; to whose play I now return.</p>

<p>Besides Morose, there are at least nine or ten different characters
and humours in the "Silent Woman;" all which persons have several
concernments of their own, yet are all used by the poet, to the
conducting of the main design to perfection. I shall not waste time in
commending the writing of this play; but I will give you my opinion,
that there is more wit and acuteness of fancy in it than in any of
Ben Jonson's. Besides, that he has here described the conversation of
gentlemen in the persons of True-Wit, and his friends, with more gaiety,
air, and freedom, than in the rest of his comedies.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
For the contrivance of the plot, 'tis extreme, elaborate,
and yet withal easy; for the λύσις, or untying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
of it, 'tis so admirable, that when it is done, no one of the audience
would think the poet could have missed it; and yet it was concealed so
much before the last scene, that any other way would sooner have entered
into your thoughts. But I dare not take upon me to commend the fabric of
it, because it is altogether so full of art, that I must unravel every
scene in it to commend it as I ought. And this excellent contrivance is
still the more to be admired, because 'tis comedy where the persons are
only of common rank, and their business private, not elevated by passions
or high concernments, as in serious plays. Here every one is a proper
judge of all he sees; nothing is represented but that with which he daily
converses: so that by consequence all faults lie open to discovery, and
few are pardonable. 'Tis this which Horace has judiciously observed:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Creditur, ex medio quia res arcessit, habere</i></div>

  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Plus oneris, quanto veniæ minus.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But our poet, who was not ignorant of these difficulties, has made
use of all advantages; as he who designs a large leap, takes his rise
from the highest ground. One of these advantages is that which Corneille
has laid down as the greatest which can arrive to any poem, and which
he himself could never compass above thrice in all his plays; viz. the
making choice of some signal and long-expected day, whereon the action
of the play is to depend. This day was that designed by Dauphine for the
settling of his uncle's estate upon him; which, to compass, he contrives
to marry him. That the marriage had been plotted by him long beforehand,
is made evident, by what he tells True-Wit in the second act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
that in one moment he had destroyed what he had been raising many
months.</p>

<p>There is another artifice of the poet, which I cannot here omit,
because by the frequent practice of it in his comedies, he has left it to
us almost as a rule; that is, when he has any character or humour wherein
he would shew a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coupe de maître</i>, or his highest skill, he recommends it
to your observation, by a pleasant description of it before the person
first appears. Thus, in "Bartholomew-Fair," he gives you the pictures
of Numps and Cokes, and in this, those of Daw, Lafoole, Morose, and the
Collegiate Ladies; all which you hear described before you see them. So
that before they come upon the stage, you have a longing expectation of
them, which prepares you to receive them favourably; and when they are
there, even from their first appearance you are so far acquainted with
them, that nothing of their humour is lost to you.</p>

<p>I will observe yet one thing further of this admirable plot; the
business of it rises in every act. The second is greater than the first;
the third than the second; and so forward to the fifth. There too you
see, till the very last scene, new difficulties arising to obstruct
the action of the play; and when the audience is brought into despair
that the business can naturally be effected, then, and not before, the
discovery is made. But that the poet might entertain you with more
variety all this while, he reserves some new characters to shew you,
which he opens not till the second and third act. In the second, Morose,
Daw, the Barber, and Otter; in the third, the Collegiate Ladies; all
which he moves afterwards in by-walks, or under-plots, as diversions
to the main design, lest it should grow tedious, though they are still
naturally joined with it, and somewhere or other subservient to it. Thus,
like a skilful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
chess-player, by little and little he draws out his men, and makes his
pawns of use to his greater persons.</p>

<p>If this comedy, and some others of his, were translated into French
prose, (which would now be no wonder to them, since Moliere has lately
given them plays out of verse, which have not displeased them,) I believe
the controversy would soon be decided betwixt the two nations, even
making them the judges.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But we need not call our heroes to our
aid; be it spoken to the honour of the English, our nation can never
want in any age such, who are able to dispute the empire of wit with any
people in the universe. And though the fury of a civil war, and power,
for twenty years together, abandoned to a barbarous race of men, enemies
of all good learning, had buried the muses under the ruins of monarchy;
yet, with the restoration of our happiness, we see revived poesy lifting
up its head, and already shaking off the rubbish which lay so heavy on
it. We have seen since his majesty's return, many dramatic poems which
yield not to those of any foreign nation, and which deserve all laurels
but the English. I will set aside flattery and envy; it cannot be denied
but we have had some little blemish either in the plot or writing of all
those plays which have been made within these seven years; and perhaps
there is no nation in the world so quick to discern them, or so difficult
to pardon them, as ours: yet if we can persuade ourselves to use the
candour of that poet, who, though the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
severe of critics, has left us this caution by which to moderate our
censures&mdash;</p>

<p>if, in consideration of their many and great beauties, we can wink at
some slight and little imperfections, if we, I say, can be thus equal to
ourselves, I ask no favour from the French. And if I do not venture upon
any particular judgment of our late plays, 'tis out of the consideration
which an ancient writer gives me: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vivorum, ut magna admiratio, ita
censura difficilis</i>: betwixt the extremes of admiration and malice, 'tis
hard to judge uprightly of the living. Only I think it may be permitted
me to say, that as it is no lessening to us to yield to some plays, and
those not many, of our own nation, in the last age, so can it be no
addition to pronounce of our present poets, that they have far surpassed
all the ancients, and the modern writers of other countries.</p>

<p>This was the substance of what was then spoke on that occasion; and
Lisideius, I think, was going to reply, when he was prevented thus by
Crites:&mdash;I am confident, said he, that the most material things
that can be said, have been already urged on either side; if they have
not, I must beg of Lisideius, that he will defer his answer till another
time: for I confess I have a joint quarrel to you both, because you have
concluded, without any reason given for it, that rhyme is proper for the
stage. I will not dispute how ancient it hath been among us to write this
way; perhaps our ancestors knew no better till Shakespeare's time. I will
grant it was not altogether left by him, and that Fletcher and Ben Jonson
used it frequently in their pastorals, and sometimes in other plays.
Farther, I will not argue whether we received it originally from our own
countrymen, or from the French; for that is an inquiry of as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
benefit as theirs, who, in the midst of the late plague, were not so
solicitous to provide against it, as to know whether we had it from the
malignity of our own air, or by transportation from Holland. I have
therefore only to affirm, that it is not allowable in serious plays; for
comedies, I find you already concluding with me. To prove this, I might
satisfy myself to tell you, how much in vain it is for you to strive
against the stream of the people's inclination; the greatest part of
which are prepossessed so much with those excellent plays of Shakespeare,
Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, which have been written out of rhyme, that
except you could bring them such as were written better in it, and those
too by persons of equal reputation with them, it will be impossible for
you to gain your cause with them, who will still be judges. This it is
to which, in fine, all your reasons must submit. The unanimous consent
of an audience is so powerful, that even Julius Cæsar, (as Macrobius
reports of him,) when he was perpetual dictator, was not able to balance
it on the other side; but when Laberius, a Roman knight, at his request
contended in the <em>Mime</em> with another poet, he was forced to cry out,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Etiam favente me victus es, Laberi</i>. But I will not, on this occasion,
take the advantage of the greater number, but only urge such reasons
against rhyme, as I find in the writings of those who have argued for
the other way. First then, I am of opinion, that rhyme is unnatural in a
play, because dialogue there is presented as the effect of sudden thought.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
For a play is the imitation of nature; and since no man, without
premeditation, speaks in rhyme, neither ought he to do it on the stage.
This hinders not but the fancy may be there elevated to an higher pitch
of thought than it is in ordinary discourse; for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
is a probability that men of excellent and quick parts may speak noble
things <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">extempore</i>: but those thoughts are never fettered with numbers,
or sound of verse, without study; and therefore it cannot be but
unnatural to present the most free way of speaking in that which is the
most constrained. For this reason, says Aristotle, 'tis best to write
tragedy in that kind of verse which is the least such, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
which is nearest prose: and this amongst the ancients was the iambic,
and with us is blank verse, or the measure of verse kept exactly without
rhyme. These numbers therefore are fittest for a play; the others for
a paper of verses, or a poem; blank verse being as much below them, as
rhyme is improper for the drama. And if it be objected, that neither are
blank verses made <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">extempore</i>, yet, as nearest
nature, they are still to be preferred. But there are two particular
exceptions, which many besides myself have had to verse; by which it
will appear yet more plainly, how improper it is in plays. And the first
of them is grounded on that very reason for which some have commended
rhyme; they say, the quickness of repartees in argumentative scenes
receives an ornament from verse. Now what is more unreasonable than to
imagine, that a man should not only light upon the wit, but the rhyme
too, upon the sudden? This nicking of him who spoke before both in sound
and measure, is so great an happiness, that you must at least suppose the
persons of your play to be born poets: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Arcades omnes, et cantare pares,
et respondere parati</i>; they must have arrived to the degree of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quicquid
conabar dicere</i>, to make verses almost whether they will or no. If they
are any thing below this, it will look rather like the design of two,
than the answer of one: it will appear that your actors hold intelligence
together; that they perform their tricks like fortune-tellers, by
confederacy. The hand of art will be too visible in it, against that
maxim of all professions&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ars est celare artem</i>; that it is the
greatest perfection of art to keep itself undiscovered. Nor will it serve
you to object, that however you manage it, 'tis still known to be a play;
and consequently, the dialogue of two persons, understood to be the labour
of one poet. For a play is still an imitation of nature; we know we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
be deceived, and we desire to be so; but no man ever was deceived but with
a probability of truth; for who will suffer a gross lie to be fastened
on him? Thus we sufficiently understand, that the scenes which represent
cities and countries to us, are not really such, but only painted on
boards and canvass; but shall that excuse the ill painture or designment
of them? Nay, rather ought they not to be laboured with so much the more
diligence and exactness, to help the imagination? since the mind of man
does naturally tend to truth; and therefore the nearer any thing comes to
the imitation of it, the more it pleases.</p>

<p>Thus, you see, your rhyme is uncapable of expressing the greatest
thoughts naturally, and the lowest it cannot with any grace: for what is
more unbefitting the majesty of verse, than to call a servant, or bid a
door be shut in rhyme? and yet you are often forced on this miserable
necessity. But verse, you say, circumscribes a quick and luxuriant fancy,
which would extend itself too far on every subject, did not the labour
which is required to well turned and polished rhyme, set bounds to it.
Yet this argument, if granted, would only prove, that we may write better
in verse, but not more naturally. Neither is it able to evince that; for
he who wants judgment to confine his fancy in blank verse, may want it as
much in rhyme; and he who has it, will avoid errors in both kinds. Latin
verse was as great a confinement to the imagination of those poets, as
rhyme to ours: and yet you find Ovid saying too much on every subject.
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nescivit</i> (says Seneca) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quod bene cessit relinquere</i>; of which he gives
you one famous instance in his description of the deluge:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Omnia pontus erat, deerant quoque litora ponto.</i></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Now all was sea, nor had that sea a shore.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Ovid's fancy was not limited by verse, and Virgil needed not
verse to have bounded his.</p>

<p>In our own language we see Ben Jonson confining himself to what ought
to be said, even in the liberty of blank verse; and yet Corneille, the
most judicious of the French poets, is still varying the same sense an
hundred ways, and dwelling eternally on the same subject, though confined
by rhyme. Some other exceptions I have to verse; but since these I have
named are for the most part already public, I conceive it reasonable they
should first be answered.</p>

<p>It concerns me less than any, said Neander, (seeing he had ended,) to
reply to this discourse; because when I should have proved, that verse
may be natural in plays, yet I should always be ready to confess, that
those which I have written in this kind come short of that perfection
which is required.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Yet
since you are pleased I should undertake this province, I will do it,
though with all imaginable respect and deference, both to that person
from whom you have borrowed your strongest arguments, and to whose
judgment, when I have said all, I finally submit. But before I proceed
to answer your objections, I must first remember you, that I exclude all
comedy from my defence; and next, that I deny not but blank verse may
be also used, and content myself only to assert, that in serious plays,
where the subject and characters are great, and the plot unmixed with
mirth, which might allay or divert these concernments which are produced,
rhyme is there as natural, and more effectual, than blank verse.</p>

<p>And now having laid down this as a foundation,&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
begin with Crites,&mdash;I must crave leave to tell him, that some of
his arguments against rhyme reach no farther than, from the faults or
defects of ill rhyme, to conclude against the use of it in general. May
not I conclude against blank verse by the same reason? If the words of
some poets, who write in it, are either ill chosen, or ill placed, (which
makes not only rhyme, but all kind of verse in any language unnatural,)
shall I, for their vicious affectation, condemn those excellent lines of
Fletcher, which are written in that kind? Is there any thing in rhyme
more constrained than this line in blank verse?&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I heaven invoke, and strong resistance make;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>where you see both the clauses are placed unnaturally; that is,
contrary to the common way of speaking, and that without the excuse of a
rhyme to cause it: yet you would think me very ridiculous, if I should
accuse the stubbornness of blank verse for this, and not rather the
stiffness of the poet. Therefore, Crites, you must either prove, that
words, though well chosen, and duly placed, yet render not rhyme natural
in itself; or that however natural and easy the rhyme may be, yet it is
not proper for a play. If you insist on the former part, I would ask
you, what other conditions are required to make rhyme natural in itself,
besides an election of apt words, and a right disposition of them? For
the due choice of your words expresses your sense naturally, and the due
placing them adapts the rhyme to it. If you object, that one verse may be
made for the sake of another, though both the words and rhyme be apt, I
answer, it cannot possibly so fall out; for either there is a dependance
of sense betwixt the first line and the second, or there is none: if
there be that connection, then in the natural position of the words the
latter line must of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
flow from the former; if there be no dependance, yet still the due
ordering of words makes the last line as natural in itself as the other:
so that the necessity of a rhyme never forces any but bad or lazy writers
to say what they would not otherwise. 'Tis true, there is both care and
art required to write in verse. A good poet never establishes the first
line, till he has sought out such a rhyme as may fit the sense, already
prepared to heighten the second: many times the close of the sense falls
into the middle of the next verse, or farther off, and he may often
avail himself of the same advantages in English which Virgil had in
Latin,&mdash;he may break off in the hemistick, and begin another line.
Indeed, the not observing these two last things, makes plays which are
writ in verse so tedious: for though, most commonly, the sense is to be
confined to the couplet, yet nothing that does <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">perpetuo tenore fluere</i>,
run in the same channel, can please always. 'Tis like the murmuring of
a stream, which, not varying in the fall, causes at first attention, at
last drowsiness. Variety of cadences is the best rule; the greatest help
to the actors, and refreshment to the audience.</p>

<p>If then verse may be made natural in itself, how becomes it unnatural
in a play? You say the stage is the representation of nature, and no man
in ordinary conversation speaks in rhyme. But you foresaw, when you said
this, that it might be answered&mdash;neither does any man speak in blank
verse, or in measure without rhyme. Therefore you concluded, that which
is nearest nature is still to be preferred. But you took no notice, that
rhyme might be made as natural as blank verse, by the well placing of
the words, &amp;c. All the difference between them, when they are both
correct, is the sound in one, which the other wants; and if so, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
sweetness of it, and all the advantage resulting from it, which are
handled in the preface to the "Rival Ladies," will yet stand good. As
for that place of Aristotle, where he says plays should be writ in that
kind of verse which is nearest prose, it makes little for you; blank
verse being properly but measured prose. Now measure alone, in any modern
language, does not constitute verse; those of the ancients in Greek and
Latin consisted in quantity of words, and a determinate number of feet.
But when, by the inundation of the Goths and Vandals into Italy, new
languages were introduced, and barbarously mingled with the Latin, of
which the Italian, Spanish, French, and ours, (made out of them and the
Teutonic,) are dialects, a new way of poesy was practised; new, I say, in
those countries, for in all probability it was that of the conquerors in
their own nations: at least we are able to prove, that the eastern people
have used it from all antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
This new way consisted in measure or number of feet, and rhyme. The
sweetness of rhyme, and observation of accent, supplying the place of
quantity in words, which could neither exactly be observed by those
barbarians, who knew not the rules of it, neither was it suitable to
their tongues as it had been to the Greek and Latin. No man is tied
in modern poesy to observe any farther rule in the feet of his verse,
but that they be dissyllables; whether Spondee, Trochee, or Iambic, it
matters not; only he is obliged to rhyme: neither do the Spanish, French,
Italian, or Germans, acknowledge at all, or very rarely, any such kind of
poesy as blank verse amongst them. Therefore, at most 'tis but a poetic
prose, a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sermo pedestris</i>; and, as such, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
fit for comedies, where I acknowledge rhyme to be improper. Farther, as
to that quotation of Aristotle, our couplet verses may be rendered as
near prose as blank verse itself, by using those advantages I lately
named,&mdash;as breaks in an hemistick, or running the sense into another
line,&mdash;thereby making art and order appear as loose and free as
nature: or not tying ourselves to couplets strictly, we may use the
benefit of the Pindaric way, practised in the "Siege of Rhodes;" where
the numbers vary, and the rhyme is disposed carelessly, and far from
often chyming. Neither is that other advantage of the ancients to be
despised, of changing the kind of verse when they please, with the change
of the scene, or some new entrance; for they confine not themselves
always to iambics, but extend their liberty to all lyric numbers, and
sometimes even to hexameter. But I need not go so far to prove, that
rhyme, as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin verse, so
especially to this of plays, since the custom of nations at this day
confirms it; the French, Italian, and Spanish tragedies are generally
writ in it; and sure the universal consent of the most civilized parts
of the world, ought in this, as it doth in other customs, to include the
rest.</p>

<p>But perhaps you may tell me, I have proposed such a way to make rhyme
natural, and consequently proper to plays, as is unpracticable; and
that I shall scarce find six or eight lines together in any play, where
the words are so placed and chosen as is required to make it natural. I
answer, no poet need constrain himself at all times to it. It is enough
he makes it his general rule; for I deny not but sometimes there may be
a greatness in placing the words otherwise; and sometimes they may sound
better; sometimes also the variety itself is excuse enough. But if, for
the most part, the words be placed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
they are in the negligence of prose, it is sufficient to denominate
the way practicable; for we esteem that to be such, which in the trial
oftener succeeds than misses. And thus far you may find the practice made
good in many plays: where you do not, remember still, that if you cannot
find six natural rhymes together, it will be as hard for you to produce
as many lines in blank verse, even among the greatest of our poets,
against which I cannot make some reasonable exception.</p>

<p>And this, sir, calls to my remembrance the beginning of your
discourse, where you told us we should never find the audience favourable
to this kind of writing, till we could produce as good plays in rhyme,
as Ben Jonson, Fletcher, and Shakespeare, had writ out of it. But it is
to raise envy to the living, to compare them with the dead. They are
honoured, and almost adored by us, as they deserve; neither do I know
any so presumptuous of themselves as to contend with them. Yet give me
leave to say thus much, without injury to their ashes, that not only
we shall never equal them, but they could never equal themselves, were
they to rise and write again. We acknowledge them our fathers in wit,
but they have ruined their estates themselves, before they came to their
children's hands. There is scarce an humour, a character, or any kind of
plot, which they have not used. All comes sullied or wasted to us: and
were they to entertain this age, they could not now make so plenteous
treatments out of such decayed fortunes. This therefore will be a good
argument to us either not to write at all, or to attempt some other way.
There is no bays to be expected in their walks: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tentanda via est, quâ me
quoque possum tollere humo</i>.</p>

<p>This way of writing in verse, they have only left free to us; our age
is arrived to a perfection in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
which they never knew; and which (if we may guess by what of theirs we
have seen in verse, as the "Faithful Shepherdess," and "Sad Shepherd")
it is probable they never could have reached. For the genius of every
age is different; and though ours excel in this, I deny not but that
to imitate nature in that perfection which they did in prose, is a
greater commendation than to write in verse exactly. As for what you
have added,&mdash;that the people are not generally inclined to like
this way,&mdash;if it were true, it would be no wonder, that betwixt the
shaking off an old habit, and the introducing of a new, there should be
difficulty. Do we not see them stick to Hopkins and Sternhold's Psalms,
and forsake those of David, I mean Sandys his translation of them? If by
the people you understand the multitude, the ὁι πολλοὶ,
it is no matter what they think; they are sometimes in the right,
sometimes in the wrong: their judgment is a mere lottery. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Est ubi plebs
recté putat, est ubi peccat.</i><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Horace says it of
the vulgar, judging poesy. But if you mean the mixed audience of the
populace and the noblesse, I dare confidently affirm, that a great part
of the latter sort are already favourable to verse; and that no serious
plays, written since the king's return, have been more kindly received by
them, than "The Siege of Rhodes," the "Mustapha," "The Indian Queen," and
"Indian Emperor."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>But I come now to the inference of your first argument.
You said, that the dialogue of plays is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
presented as the effect of sudden thought, but no man speaks suddenly, or
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">extempore</i>, in rhyme; and you inferred from thence, that rhyme, which
you acknowledge to be proper to epic poesy, cannot equally be proper to
dramatic, unless we could suppose all men born so much more than poets,
that verses should be made in them, not by them.</p>

<p>It has been formerly urged by you, and confessed by me, that since no
man spoke any kind of verse <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">extempore</i>, that which was nearest nature
was to be preferred. I answer you, therefore, by distinguishing betwixt
what is nearest to the nature of comedy, which is the imitation of
common persons and ordinary speaking, and what is nearest the nature of
a serious play: this last is indeed the representation of nature, but
'tis nature wrought up to an higher pitch. The plot, the characters, the
wit, the passions, the descriptions, are all exalted above the level of
common converse, as high as the imagination of the poet can carry them,
with proportion to verisimility. Tragedy, we know, is wont to image to us
the minds and fortunes of noble persons, and to pourtray these exactly;
heroic rhyme is nearest nature, as being the noblest kind of modern
verse.</p>

<p>Blank verse is acknowledged to be too low for a poem, nay more, for a
paper of verses; but if too low for an ordinary sonnet, how much more for
tragedy, which is by Aristotle, in the dispute betwixt the epic poesy and
the dramatic, for many reasons he there alleges, ranked above it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>But setting this defence aside, your argument is almost as strong
against the use of rhyme in poems as in plays; for the epic way is every
where interlaced with dialogue, or discoursive scenes; and therefore you
must either grant rhyme to be improper there, which is contrary to your
assertion, or admit it into plays by the same title which you have given
it to poems. For though tragedy be justly preferred above the other, yet
there is a great affinity between them, as may easily be discovered in
that definition of a play which Lisideius gave us. The <i>genus</i> of them is
the same,&mdash;a just and lively image of human nature, in its actions,
passions, and traverses of fortune: so is the end,&mdash;namely for the
delight and benefit of mankind. The characters and persons are still the
same, <i>viz.</i> the greatest of both sorts; only the manner of acquainting
us with those actions, passions, and fortunes, is different. Tragedy
performs it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">viva voce</i>, or by action, in dialogue; wherein it excels the
epic poem, which does it chiefly by narration, and therefore is not so
lively an image of human nature. However, the agreement betwixt them is
such, that if rhyme be proper for one, it must be for the other. Verse,
'tis true, is not the effect of sudden thought; but this hinders not that
sudden thought may be represented in verse, since those thoughts are
such as must be higher than nature can raise them without premeditation,
especially to a continuance of them, even out of verse; and consequently
you cannot imagine them to have been sudden either in the poet, or the
actors. A play, as I have said, to be like nature, is to be set above it;
as statues which are placed on high are made greater than the life, that
they may descend to the sight in their just proportion.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have insisted too long on this objection;
but the clearing of it will make my stay shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
on the rest. You tell us, Crites, that rhyme appears most unnatural in
repartees, or short replies: when he who answers, (it being presumed he
knew not what the other would say, yet) makes up that part of the verse
which was left incomplete, and supplies both the sound and measure of it.
This, you say, looks rather like the confederacy of two, than the answer
of one.</p>

<p>This, I confess, is an objection which is in every man's mouth, who
loves not rhyme: but suppose, I beseech you, the repartee were made only
in blank verse, might not part of the same argument be turned against
you? for the measure is as often supplied there as it is in rhyme; the
latter half of the hemistick as commonly made up, or a second line
subjoined, as a reply to the former; which any one leaf in Jonson's
plays will sufficiently clear to you. You will often find in the Greek
tragedians, and in Seneca, that when a scene grows up into the warmth of
repartees, (which is the close fighting of it,) the latter part of the
trimeter is supplied by him who answers; and yet it was never observed as
a fault in them by any of the ancient or modern critics.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
The case is the same in our verse as it was in theirs; rhyme to us being
in lieu of quantity to them. But if no latitude is to be allowed a poet,
you take from him not only his licence of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quidlibet audendi</i>, but you
tie him up in a straiter compass than you would a philosopher. This is
indeed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Musas colere severiores</i>. You would have him follow nature, but
he must follow her on foot: you have dismounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
him from his Pegasus. But you tell us, this supplying the last half of
a verse, or adjoining a whole second to the former, looks more like the
design of two, than the answer of one. Suppose we acknowledge it: How
comes this confederacy to be more displeasing to you than in a dance
which is well contrived? You see there the united design of many persons
to make up one figure: after they have separated themselves in many petty
divisions, they rejoin one by one into a gross: the confederacy is plain
amongst them, for chance could never produce any thing so beautiful; and
yet there is nothing in it that shocks your sight. I acknowledge the hand
of art appears in repartee, as of necessity it must in all kind of verse.
But there is also the quick and poignant brevity of it (which is an high
imitation of nature in those sudden gusts of passion) to mingle with it;
and this, joined with the cadency and sweetness of the rhyme, leaves
nothing in the soul of the hearer to desire. It is an art which appears;
but it appears only like the shadowings of painture, which being to cause
the rounding of it, cannot be absent; but while that is considered, they
are lost: so while we attend to the other beauties of the matter, the
care and labour of the rhyme is carried from us, or at least drowned in
its own sweetness, as bees are sometimes buried in their honey. When a
poet has found the repartee, the last perfection he can add to it, is, to
put it into verse. However good the thought may be, however apt the words
in which it is couched, yet he finds himself at a little unrest, while
rhyme is wanting. He cannot leave it till that comes naturally, and then
is at ease, and sits down contented.</p>

<p>From replies, which are the most elevated thoughts
of verse, you pass to those which are most mean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
and which are common with this lowest of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'houshold'">household</ins> conversation. In
these, you say, the majesty of verse suffers. You instance in the calling
of a servant, or commanding a door to be shut, in rhyme. This, Crites, is
a good observation of yours, but no argument: for it proves no more but
that such thoughts should be waved, as often as may be, by the address
of the poet. But suppose they are necessary in the places where he uses
them, yet there is no need to put them into rhyme. He may place them in
the beginning of a verse, and break it off, as unfit, when so debased,
for any other use; or granting the worst,&mdash;that they require more
room than the hemistick will allow, yet still there is a choice to be
made of the best words, and least vulgar, provided they be apt to express
such thoughts. Many have blamed rhyme in general, for this fault, when
the poet, with a little care, might have redressed it. But they do it
with no more justice, than if English poesy should be made ridiculous for
the sake of the Water-poet's rhymes.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Our language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>is noble, full, and significant; and I know not why
he who is master of it may not clothe ordinary things in it as decently
as the Latin, if he use the same diligence in his choice of words:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Delectus verborum origo est eloquentiæ.</i></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was the saying of Julius Cæsar, one so curious
in his, that none of them can be changed but for a
worse. One would think, <em>unlock the door</em>, was a
thing as vulgar as could be spoken; and yet Seneca
could make it sound high and lofty in his Latin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Reserate clusos regii postes laris.</i><a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Set wide the palace gates.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I turn from this exception, both because it happens not above
twice or thrice in any play that those vulgar thoughts are used; and then
too, were there no other apology to be made, yet the necessity of them,
which is alike in all kind of writing, may excuse them. For if they are
little and mean in rhyme, they are of consequence such in blank verse.
Besides that the great eagerness and precipitation with which they are
spoken, makes us rather mind the substance than the dress; that for which
they are spoken, rather than what is spoke. For they are always the
effect of some hasty concernment, and something of consequence depends on
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, Crites, I have endeavoured to answer your objections: it remains
only that I should vindicate an argument for verse, which you have gone
about to overthrow. It had formerly been said, that the easiness of
blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant; but that the labour of rhyme
bounds and circumscribes an over-fruitful fancy; the sense there being
commonly confined to the couplet, and the words so ordered, that the
rhyme naturally follows them, not they the rhyme. To this you answered,
that it was no argument to the question in hand; for the dispute was not
which way a man may write best, but which is most proper for the subject
on which he writes.</p>

<p>First, give me leave, sir, to remember you, that the argument against
which you raised this objection, was only secondary: it was built on this
hypothesis,&mdash;that to write in verse was proper for serious plays.
Which supposition being granted, (as it was briefly made out in that
discourse, by shewing how verse might be made natural,) it asserted, that
this way of writing was an help to the poet's judgment, by putting bounds
to a wild overflowing fancy. I think therefore it will not be hard for
me to make good what it was to prove on that supposition. But you add,
that were this let pass, yet he who wants judgment in the liberty of his
fancy, may as well shew the defect of it when he is confined to verse;
for he who has judgment will avoid errors, and he who has it not, will
commit them in all kinds of writing.</p>

<p>This argument, as you have taken it from a most
acute person,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> so, I confess, it carries much weight
in it: but by using the word judgment here indefinitely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
you seem to have put a fallacy upon us. I grant, he who has judgment,
that is, so profound, so strong, or rather so infallible a judgment, that
he needs no helps to keep it always poised and upright, will commit no
faults either in rhyme, or out of it. And on the other extreme, he who
has a judgment so weak and crazed, that no helps can correct or amend
it, shall write scurvily out of rhyme, and worse in it. But the first of
these judgments is no where to be found, and the latter is not fit to
write at all. To speak therefore of judgment as it is in the best poets;
they who have the greatest proportion of it, want other helps than from
it, within. As for example, you would be loth to say, that he who is
endued with a sound judgment, has no need of history, geography, or moral
philosophy, to write correctly. Judgment is indeed the master-workman
in a play; but he requires many subordinate hands, many tools to his
assistance. And verse I affirm to be one of these: it is a rule and line
by which he keeps his building compact and even, which otherwise lawless
imagination would raise either irregularly or loosely; at least, if
the poet commits errors with this help, he would make greater and more
without it:&mdash;it is, in short, a slow and painful, but the surest
kind of working. Ovid, whom you accuse for luxuriancy in verse, had
perhaps been farther guilty of it, had he writ in prose. And for your
instance of Ben Jonson, who, you say, writ exactly without the help of
rhyme; you are to remember, it is only an aid to a luxuriant fancy, which
his was not: as he did not want imagination, so none ever said he had
much to spare. Neither was verse then refined so much, to be an help to
that age, as it is to ours. Thus then the second thoughts being usually
the best, as receiving the maturest digestion from judgment, and the last
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
most mature product of those thoughts being artful and laboured verse, it
may well be inferred, that verse is a great help to a luxuriant fancy;
and this is what that argument which you opposed was to evince.</p>

<p>Neander was pursuing this discourse so eagerly, that Eugenius had
called to him twice or thrice, ere he took notice that the barge stood
still, and that they were at the foot of Somerset-stairs, where they had
appointed it to land. The company were all sorry to separate so soon,
though a great part of the evening was already spent; and stood awhile
looking back on the water, upon which the moon-beams played, and made it
appear like floating quicksilver: at last they went up through a crowd of
French people,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> who were merrily dancing in the
open air, and nothing concerned for the noise of guns, which had alarmed
the town that afternoon. Walking thence together to the Piazze, they
parted there; Eugenius and Lisideius to some pleasant appointment they
had made, and Crites and Neander to their several lodgings.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />

AN ANSWER TO RYMER's REMARKS, &amp;c.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p>Thomas Rymer, distinguished as the editor of the <i>F&oelig;dera</i> of
England, was in his earlier years ambitious of the fame of a critic.
In 1678, he published a small duodecimo, entitled, "The Tragedies
of the last Age considered and examined by the practice of
the Ancients, and the common Sense of all Ages, in a Letter to
Fleetwood and Shepherd." The criticisms apply chiefly to the
tragedies of the latter part of the reigns of Elizabeth, and James I.;
out of which he has singled, as the particular subjects of reprehension,
those of "Rollo," "The Maid's Tragedy," and "King and
no King." In this criticism, there was "much malice mingled
with a little wit;" obvious faults and absurdities were censured
as disgusting to common sense, on the one hand; on the other, licenses
unpractised by the ancients were condemned as barbarous
and unclassical.</p>

<p>A severe critic, if able but plausibly to support his remarks by
learning and acumen, strikes terror through the whole world of
literature. It is in vain to represent to such a person, that he
only examines the debtor side of the account, and omits to credit
the unfortunate author with the merit that he has justly a title
to claim. Instead of a fair accounting between the public and
the poet, his cause is tried as in a criminal action, where, if he is
convicted of a crime, all the merit of his work will not excuse
him. There must be something in the mind of man favourable
to a system which tends to the levelling of talents in the public
estimation, or such critics as Rymer could never have risen into
notice. Yet Dryden, in the following projected answer to his Remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
has treated him with great respect; and Pope, according to
Spence, pronounced him "one of the best critics we ever had."</p>

<p>That Dryden should have been desirous to conciliate the favour
of an avowed critic, was natural enough; but that Pope should
have so spoken of Rymer, only argues, either that he was prejudiced
by the opinions which his youth had sucked in from
Walsh, Wycherly, and Trumbull, or that his taste for the drama
was far inferior to his powers in every other range of poetry.</p>

<p>If Dryden had arranged and extended the materials of his answer,
it is possible that he would have treated Rymer with less
deference than he shewed while collecting them; for in the latter
years of Dryden's life they were upon bad terms. See Vol. xii.
p. 45, and Epistle to Congreve, Vol. xi. p. 57.</p>

<p>To a reader of the present day, when the cant of criticism has
been in some degree abandoned, nothing can be more disgusting
than the remarks of Rymer, who creeps over the most beautiful
passages of the drama with eyes open only to their defects, or
their departure from scholastic precept; who denies the name of
poetry to the "Paradise Lost," and compares judging of "Rollo" by
"Othello," to adjusting one crooked line by another. But I would
be by no means understood to say, that there is not sometimes
justice, though never mercy, in his criticism.</p>

<p>Dryden had intended to enter the lists with Rymer in defence
of the ancient theatre, and with this view had wrote the following
Heads of an Answer to the Remarks. They were jotted down on
the blank leaves of a copy of the book presented to Dryden by
Rymer. The volume falling into the hands of the publisher of
Beaumont and Fletcher's works, in 1711, they prefixed Dryden's
observations, as furnishing an apology for their authors. They
were again published by Dr Johnson, into whose hands they were
put by Garrick, who had the original in his collection. The arrangement
is different in the two copies; that of Dr Johnson has
been adopted, as preferred by Mr Malone.</p>

<span class="smaller2">TRAGEDIES OF THE LAST AGE.</span></h2>
<hr class="r10" />

<p><span class="first drop">T</span><span class="smcap">hat</span> we may the less wonder why pity and terror
are not now the only springs on which our
tragedies move,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and that Shakespeare may be
more excused, Rapin confesses, that the French tragedies now all run
on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tendre</i>; and gives the reason, because love is the passion
which most predominates in our souls; and that therefore the passions
represented become insipid, unless they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
conformable to the thoughts of the audience. But it is to be concluded,
that this passion works not now amongst the French so strongly, as the
other two did amongst the ancients. Amongst us, who have a stronger
genius for writing, the operations from the writing are much stronger;
for the raising of Shakespeare's passions is more from the excellency
of the words and thoughts, than the justness of the occasion; and if he
has been able to pick single occasions, he has never founded the whole
reasonably; yet, by the genius of poetry in writing, he has succeeded.</p>

<p>Rapin attributes more to the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictio</i>, that is, to the words and
discourse of a tragedy, than Aristotle has done, who places them in
the last rank of beauties; perhaps, only last in order, because they
are the last product of the design, of the disposition or connection
of its parts, of the characters, of the manners of those characters,
and of the thoughts proceeding from those manners. Rapin's words are
remarkable:&mdash;It is not the admirable intrigue, the surprising
events, and extraordinary incidents, that make the beauty of a tragedy;
it is the discourses, when they are natural and passionate.&mdash;So are
Shakespeare's.</p>

<p>The parts of a poem, tragic or heroic, are,</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The fable itself.</p>

<p>2. The order or manner of its contrivance, in relation of the parts to
the whole.</p>

<p>3. The manners, or decency of the characters, in speaking or acting
what is proper for them, and proper to be shewn by the poet.</p>

<p>4. The thoughts, which express the manners.</p>

<p>5. The words, which express those thoughts.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the last of these, Homer excels Virgil; Virgil all other ancient
poets; and Shakespeare all modern poets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>For the second of these, the order: the meaning is, that a fable
ought to have a beginning, middle, and an end, all just and natural;
so that that part, <i>e.g.</i> which is the middle, could not naturally be
the beginning or end, and so of the rest: all depend on one another,
like the links of a curious chain. If terror and pity are only to
be raised, certainly this author follows Aristotle's rules, and
Sophocles' and Euripides's example; but joy may be raised too, and that
doubly, either by seeing a wicked man punished, or a good man at last
fortunate; or perhaps indignation, to see wickedness prosperous, and
goodness depressed: both these may be profitable to the end of tragedy,
reformation of manners; but the last improperly, only as it begets pity
in the audience; though Aristotle, I confess, places tragedies of this
kind in the second form.</p>

<p>He who undertakes to answer this excellent critique of Mr Rymer, in
behalf of our English poets against the Greek, ought to do it in this
manner: either by yielding to him the greatest part of what he contends
for, which consists in this, that the μύθος
<i>i.e.</i> the design and conduct of it, is more conducing in the Greeks to
those ends of tragedy, which Aristotle and he propose, namely, to cause
terror and pity; yet the granting this does not set the Greeks above the
English poets.</p>

<p>But the answerer ought to prove two things: First, that the fable is
not the greatest master-piece of a tragedy, though it be the foundation
of it.</p>

<p>Secondly, that other ends, as suitable to the nature of tragedy, may
be found in the English, which were not in the Greek.</p>

<p>Aristotle places the fable first; not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quoad dignitatem,
sed quoad fundamentum</i>: for a fable, never so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
movingly contrived to those ends of his, pity and terror, will operate
nothing on our affections, except the characters, manners, thoughts, and
words, are suitable.</p>

<p>So that it remains for Mr Rymer to prove, that in all those, or the
greatest part of them, we are inferior to Sophocles and Euripides; and
this he has offered at, in some measure; but, I think, a little partially
to the ancients.</p>

<p>For the fable itself: it is in the English more adorned with episodes,
and larger than in the Greek poets; consequently more diverting. For if
the action be but one, and that plain, without any counter-turn of design
or episode, <i>i.e.</i> under-plot, how can it be so pleasing as the English,
which have both under-plot and a turned design, which keeps the audience
in expectation of the catastrophe? whereas in the Greek poets we see
through the whole design at first.</p>

<p>For the characters, they are neither so many nor so various in
Sophocles and Euripides, as in Shakespeare and Fletcher; only they are
more adapted to those ends of tragedy which Aristotle commends to us,
pity and terror.</p>

<p>The manners flow from the characters, and consequently must partake of
their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>The thoughts and words, which are the fourth and fifth beauties of
tragedy, are certainly more noble and more poetical in the English than
in the Greek, which must be proved by comparing them somewhat more
equitably than Mr Rymer has done.</p>

<p>After all, we need not yield, that the English way
is less conducing to move pity and terror, because
they often shew virtue oppressed and vice punished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
where they do not both, or either, they are not to be defended.</p>

<p>And if we should grant that the Greeks performed this better, perhaps
it may admit of dispute, whether pity and terror are either the prime, or
at least the only ends of tragedy.</p>

<p>It is not enough that Aristotle has said so, for Aristotle drew his
models of tragedy from Sophocles and Euripides; and if he had seen ours,
might have changed his mind. And chiefly we have to say, (what I hinted
on pity and terror, in the last paragraph save one,) that the punishment
of vice and reward of virtue are the most adequate ends of tragedy,
because most conducing to good example of life. Now pity is not so easily
raised for a criminal, (and the ancient tragedy always represents its
chief person such,) as it is for an innocent man; and the suffering of
innocence and punishment of the offender is of the nature of English
tragedy: contrarily, in the Greek, innocence is unhappy often, and the
offender escapes. Then we are not touched with the sufferings of any sort
of men so much as of lovers, and this was almost unknown to the ancients:
so that they neither administered poetical justice, of which Mr Rymer
boasts, so well as we; neither knew they the best common-place of pity,
which is love.</p>

<p>He therefore unjustly blames us for not building on what the ancients
left us; for it seems, upon consideration of the premises, that we have
wholly finished what they began.</p>

<p>My judgment on this piece is this; that it is extremely learned, but
that the author of it is better read in the Greek than in the English
poets; that all writers ought to study this critique, as the best account
I have ever seen of the ancients; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
model of tragedy he has here given is excellent, and extreme correct;
but that it is not the only model of all tragedy, because it is too
much circumscribed in plot, characters, &amp;c.; and lastly, that we
may be taught here justly to admire and imitate the ancients, without
giving them the preference, with this author, in prejudice to our own
country.</p>

<p>Want of method in this excellent treatise, makes the thoughts of the
author sometimes obscure.</p>

<p>His meaning, that pity and terror are to be moved, is, that they are
to be moved as the means conducing to the ends of tragedy, which are
pleasure and instruction.</p>

<p>And these two ends may be thus distinguished. The chief end of the
poet is to please; for his immediate reputation depends on it.</p>

<p>The great end of the poem is to instruct, which is performed by making
pleasure the vehicle of that instruction; for poesy is an art, and all
arts are made to profit. Rapin.</p>

<p>The pity which the poet is to labour for, is for the criminal, not for
those or him whom he has murdered, or who have been the occasion of the
tragedy. The terror is likewise in the punishment of the same criminal,
who, if he be represented too great an offender, will not be pitied; if
altogether innocent, his punishment will be unjust.</p>

<p>Another obscurity is, where he says, Sophocles perfected tragedy by
introducing the third actor;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
that is, he meant, three kinds of action; one company singing, or
speaking; another playing on the music; a third dancing.</p>

<p>To make a true judgment in this competition betwixt the Greek poets
and the English, in tragedy:</p>

<p>Consider, first, how Aristotle has defined a tragedy. Secondly, what
he assigns the end of it to be. Thirdly, what he thinks the beauties of
it. Fourthly, the means to attain the end proposed.</p>

<p>Compare the Greek and English tragic poets justly, and without
partiality, according to those rules.</p>

<p>Then, secondly, consider whether Aristotle has made a just definition
of tragedy; of its parts, of its ends, and of its beauties; and whether
he, having not seen any others but those of Sophocles, Euripides, &amp;c.
had, or truly could determine what all the excellencies of tragedy are,
and wherein they consist.</p>

<p>Next shew in what ancient tragedy was deficient; for example, in the
narrowness of its plots, and fewness of persons; and try whether that
be not a fault in the Greek poets, and whether their excellency was so
great, when the variety was visibly so little; or whether what they did
was not very easy to do.</p>

<p>Then make a judgment on what the English have added to their beauties;
as, for example, not only more plot, but also new passions, as, namely,
that of love, scarce touched on by the ancients, except in this one
example of Phædra, cited by Mr Rymer; and in that how short they were of
Fletcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>Prove also that love, being an heroic passion, is fit for tragedy,
which cannot be denied, because of the example alleged of Phædra; and how
far Shakespeare has out-done them in friendship, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To return to the beginning of this enquiry; consider, if pity and
terror be enough for tragedy to move; and I believe, upon a true
definition of tragedy, it will be found, that its work extends farther,
and that is to reform manners, by a delightful representation of human
life in great persons, by way of dialogue. If this be true, then not only
pity and terror are to be moved, as the only means to bring us to virtue,
but generally love to virtue, and hatred to vice, by shewing the rewards
of one, and punishments of the other; at least, by rendering virtue
always amiable, though it be shewn unfortunate, and vice detestable,
though it be shewn triumphant.</p>

<p>If then, the encouragement of virtue, and discouragement of vice, be
the proper ends of poetry in tragedy, pity and terror, though good means,
are not the only. For all the passions, in their turns, are to be set
in a ferment; as joy, anger, love, fear, are to be used as the poet's
common-places, and a general concernment for the principal actors is to
be raised, by making them appear such in their characters, their words,
and actions, as will interest the audience in their fortunes.</p>

<p>And if, after all, in a larger sense, pity comprehends this
concernment for the good, and terror includes detestation for the bad,
then let us consider whether the English have not answered this end of
tragedy, as well as the ancients, or perhaps better.</p>

<p>And here Mr Rymer's objections against these plays are to be
impartially weighed, that we may see whether they are of weight enough to
turn the balance against our countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident, those plays which he arraigns, have
moved both those passions in a high degree upon
the stage.</p>

<p>To give the glory of this away from the poet,
and to place it upon the actors, seems unjust.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>One reason is, because whatever actors they have found, the event
has been the same, that is, the same passions have been always moved;
which shews, that there is something of force and merit in the plays
themselves, conducing to the design of raising these two passions: and
suppose them ever to have been excellently acted, yet action only adds
grace, vigour, and more life, upon the stage, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
cannot give it wholly where it is not first. But secondly, I dare appeal
to those who have never seen them acted, if they have not found these two
passions moved within them; and if the general voice will carry it, Mr
Rymer's prejudice will take off his single testimony.</p>

<p>This, being matter of fact, is reasonably to be established by this
appeal; as if one man says it is night, when the rest of the world
conclude it to be day, there needs no farther argument against him, that
it is so.</p>

<p>If he urge, that the general taste is depraved, his arguments to prove
this can at best but evince, that our poets took not the best way to
raise those passions; but experience proves against him, that those means
which they have used have been successful, and have produced them.</p>

<p>And one reason of that success is, in my opinion, this, that
Shakespeare and Fletcher have written to the genius of the age and nation
in which they lived; for though nature, as he objects, is the same in
all places, and reason too the same, yet the climate, the age, the
disposition of the people, to whom a poet writes, may be so different,
that what pleased the Greeks would not satisfy an English audience.</p>

<p>And if they proceeded upon a foundation of truer reason to please the
Athenians, than Shakespeare and Fletcher to please the English, it only
shews, that the Athenians were a more judicious people; but the poet's
business is certainly to please the audience.</p>

<p>Whether our English audience have been pleased hitherto with acorns,
as he calls it, or with bread, is the next question; that is, whether the
means which Shakespeare and Fletcher have used in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
plays to raise those passions before named, be better applied to the ends
by the Greek poets than by them. And perhaps we shall not grant him this
wholly: let it be yielded, that a writer is not to run down with the
stream, or to please the people by their own usual methods, but rather to
reform their judgments,&mdash;it still remains to prove, that our theatre
needs this total reformation.</p>

<p>The faults which he has found in their designs, are rather wittily
aggravated in many places, than reasonably urged; and as much may be
returned on the Greeks by one who were as witty as himself.</p>

<p>2. They destroy not, if they are granted, the foundation of the
fabric, only take away from the beauty of the symmetry: for example, the
faults in the character of the "King and no King"<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> are not
as he makes them, such as render him detestable, but only imperfections
which accompany human nature, and are for the most part excused by the
violence of his love; so that they destroy not our pity or concernment
for him. This answer may be applied to most of his objections of that
kind.</p>

<p>And Rollo<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> committing many murders, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
is answerable but for one, is too severely arraigned by him, for it adds
to our horror and detestation of the criminal; and poetic justice is not
neglected neither, for we stab him in our minds for every offence which
he commits; and the point which the poet is to gain on the audience is
not so much in the death of an offender, as the raising an horror of his
crimes.</p>

<p>That the criminal should neither be wholly guilty, nor wholly
innocent, but so participating of both as to move both pity and terror,
is certainly a good rule, but not perpetually to be observed; for that
were to make all tragedies too much alike; which objection he foresaw,
but has not fully answered.</p>

<p>To conclude, therefore; if the plays of the ancients are more
correctly plotted, ours are more beautifully written. And if we can raise
passions as high on worse foundations, it shews our genius in tragedy
is greater; for, in all other parts of it, the English have manifestly
excelled them.</p>

THE EMPRESS OF MOROCCO.</h2>
<hr class="r10" />


<p>The following effusion of spleen, which is altogether unworthy
of Dryden, took its rise in the animosity of literary rivalship.</p>

<p>About 1673, the Earl of Rochester, who had been formerly on
good terms with Dryden, had received a dedication from him, and
made a suitable return of compliment,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> became his bitter opponent
and enemy. This was probably owing to Dryden's intimacy
with Sheffield, Earl Mulgrave, who had challenged Rochester,
and publicly branded him with cowardice for his refusal to fight
him.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The witty and profligate courtier turned that resentment
against the poet, which he durst not shew to the patron, and
endeavoured to injure him on every opportunity.</p>

<p>Elkanah Settle, whom we have had former opportunities to
commemorate, was now rising into notice. He was the son of
Joseph Settle, of Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, and had distinguished
himself by a tragedy, called "Cambyses, King of Persia,"
which was acted for three weeks together. Emboldened by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
success, he produced a second play, entitled "The Empress of
Morocco." Upon this tragedy, and its author, Rochester fixed,
as the implements of his plan, to humble and mortify Dryden. He
made use of his influence to introduce Settle at court as a poet
greatly superior to our bard; and he was received at least upon
equal terms with him. Even Sheffield contributed to Dryden's
mortification, and, perhaps in obedience to the king, graced "The
Empress of Morocco" with a prologue of his own writing, which
was spoken by Lady Betty Howard, when the piece was presented
at Whitehall, by the gentlemen and ladies of the court. Rochester
wrote a second prologue, which was spoken by the same lady,
on a second representation of the same distinguished kind. The
bookseller contributed his share of celebrity to the piece, by decorating
it with four engravings, each representing a scene in the
play; an honour which had not hitherto been conferred on any
single play: with these decorations it sold for two shillings, being
double the common price. Lastly, the public bought up the edition
with great rapidity, and very naturally employed themselves
in weighing the merits of the new bard against those of our author,
who had hitherto reigned paramount over the drama.</p>

<p>All these circumstances combined to vex the spirit of Dryden.
There was not only a vile bombastic production publicly weighed
against his most laboured plays, but the author, presuming upon
the countenance of a numerous party among the public, had
openly bid him defiance, by sundry irreverend sneers at him in the
prefatory epistle of his garnished and bedizened performance.
This Dryden termed, "a most arrogant, calumniating, ill-natured,
and scandalous preface."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been undoubtedly wise in Dryden to have disdained to
enter the arena with such an antagonist. Settle must soon have
sunk by his own weight, to the dishonour and confusion of his supporters;
but the spirit of controversy and party were to buoy
him up a little longer. Our author, irritated and imprudent, entered
into a league with Shadwell, (afterwards a hostile name,)
and with John Crowne, another dramatist of the day, to humble
at once the pride of Settle, by such a criticism as should make
his party ashamed of their poet, and the poet of his own production.
Accordingly, "The Notes and Observations on the Empress
of Morocco," the work of the three allies, came forth in 4to,
in 1674. None of the consequences followed which Dryden had
probably expected. Settle retorted, and stupid and vulgar as he
was, it was hardly possible for him to fall beneath the Billingsgate
with which he had been assailed.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> On the contrary, he rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
gained reputation by the contest, and fairly divided with Dryden
the applauses of the court and of the universities. It was not until
the controversy subsided, that Elkanah lost his unnatural and
unmerited literary importance. In the mean time, the feud between
Dryden and him was inflamed by political hatred, and at
length procured Elkanah the bitter distinction, of being described
in "Absalom and Achitophel," under the name of Doeg. Vol.
IX. pages 331, 373.</p>

<p>It were to be wished, our author could be exculpated from any
share in the coarse and illiberal invective which follows these introductory
remarks. But it is too certain, from the evidence of
Dennis, as well as Settle's affirmation, that Dryden did stoop to
revise the pamphlet, and probably to write the preface and postscript.
These cannot therefore be rejected from a full edition of
his works; but I willingly follow Mr Malone's authority in rejecting
the rest of the pamphlet, excepting a small specimen.</p>

<p>Morally considered, the piece affords an useful lesson, how much
irritation can debase even the composition of genius. The best
satirist, like a fencer, loses the skill of his art when he loses his
temper; and if Dryden afterwards succeeded in making a ridiculous
portrait of Elkanah Settle, it was because he had lost apprehension
of him as a rival, and cooled his indignation with a
proportion of contempt suitable to its object.</p>

THE EMPRESS OF MOROCCO.</h2>
<hr class="r10" />

<p><span class="first drop">W</span><span class="smcap">hen</span> I first saw "The Empress of Morocco," though I found it then to
be a rhapsody of nonsense, I was very well contented to have let it pass,
that the reputation of a new author might not be wholly damned; but that
he might be encouraged to make his audience some part of amends another
time. In order to this, I strained a point of conscience to cry up some
passages of the play, which I hoped would recommend it to the liking of
the more favourable judges; but the ill report it had from those that had
seen it at Whitehall, had already done its business with judicious men.
It was generally disliked by them; and but for the help of scenes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
habits, and a dancing tree, even the Ludgate audience
had forsaken it.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>After this ill success, one would have thought the poet should have
been sufficiently mortified; and though he were not naturally modest,
should at least have deferred the showing of his impudence till a fitter
season: but instead of this, he has written before his play the most
arrogant, calumniating, ill-mannered, and senseless Preface I ever saw.
This upstart illiterate scribbler, who lies more open to censure than any
writer of the age, comes amongst the poets, like one of the earth-born
brethren; and his first business in the world is to attack and murder
all his fellows. This, I confess, raised a little indignation in me,
as much as I was capable of for so contemptible a wretch, and made me
think it somewhat necessary that he should be made an example, to the
discouragement of all such petulant ill writers; and that he should be
dragged out of that obscurity to which his own poetry would for ever have
condemned him. I knew, indeed, that to write against him was to do him
too great an honour; but I considered Ben Jonson had done it before to
Dekker, our author's predecessor, whom he chastised in his "Poetaster,"
under the character of Crispinus; and brought him in vomiting up his
fustian and nonsense.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
our poet have been introduced in the same manner, he must have disgorged
his whole play, ere he had been cleansed. Never did I see such a confused
heap of false grammar, improper English, strained hyperboles, and
downright bulls. His plot is incoherent, and full of absurdities, and
the characters of his persons so ill chosen, that they are all either
knaves or fools; only his knaves are fools into the bargain, and so must
be of necessity, while they are in his management. They all speak alike,
and without distinction of character; that is, every one rants, and
swaggers, and talks nonsense abundantly. He steals notoriously from his
contemporaries, but he so alters the property, by disguising his theft
in ill English and bad applications, that he makes the child his own
by deforming it:&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">male dum recitas, incipit esse tuus</i>. A poet,
when he sees his thoughts in so ill a dress, is ashamed to confess they
ever belonged to him. For the Latin and Greek authors, he had certainly
done them the same injury he has done the English, but that he has the
excuse of Aretine for not railing against God;&mdash;he steals not from
them, because he never knew them. In short, he is an animal of a most
deplored understanding, without reading and conversation: his being is
in a twilight of sense, and some glimmering of thought, which he can
never fashion either into wit or English. His style is boisterous and
rough-hewn; his rhyme incorrigibly lewd, and his numbers perpetually
harsh and ill sounding. That little talent which he has, is fancy.
He sometimes labours with a thought, but with the pudder he makes to
bring it into the world, it is commonly still-born; so that, for want
of learning and elocution, he will never be able to express any thing
either naturally or justly. This subjects him on all occasions to false
allusions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
mistaken points of wit. As for judgment, he has not the least grain of
it; and therefore all his plays will be a mere confusion. What a beastly
pattern of a king, whom he intends virtuous, has he shewn in his Muly
Labas? Yet he is the only person who is kept to his character; for he is
a perpetual fool; and I dare undertake, that if he were played by Nokes,
who acted just such another monarch in "Macbeth,"<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> it would give new life to the play,
and do it more good than all its devils. But of all women, the Lord
bless us from his Laula! nobody can be safe from her: she is so
naturally mischievous, that she kills without the least occasion, for
the mere lechery of bloodshed. I suspect he took her character from the
poisoning-woman, who, they say, makes almost as little ceremony of a
murder as that Queen.</p>

<p>It were endless to run over the rest; but they are all of the same
stamp. He has a heavy hand at fools, and a great felicity in writing
nonsense for them. Fools they will be in spite of him. His king, his
two empresses, his villain, and his sub-villain, nay his hero, have all
a certain natural cast of the father; one turn of the countenance goes
through all his children. Their folly was born and bred in them; and
something of the Elkanah will be visible. Our poet, in writing fools,
has very much in him of that sign-post painter, who was famous only for
drawing roses: when a vintner desired him to paint a lion, he answered,
he would do it to content him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
but he was sure it would be like a rose. Yet since the common audience
are much of his level, and both the great vulgar and the small (as Mr
Cowley calls them) are apt to admire what they do not understand,
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">omne ignotum habent pro magnifico</i>,) and think all which rumbles is
heroic, it will be no wonder if he pass for a great author amongst town
fools and city wits. With these men, they who laugh at him will be
thought envious; for they will be sure to rise up in arms for nonsense,
and violently defend a cause in which they are engaged by the ties of
nature and education. But it will be for the benefit of mankind hereafter
to observe what kind of people they are who frequent this play, that men
of common sense may know whom to shun. Yet I dare assure the reader, that
one half of the faults and absurdities are not shewn; what is here is
only selected fustian, impertinence, and false grammar. There is as much
behind, as would reasonably damn as many plays as there are acts; for I
am sure there are no four lines together, which are free from some error,
and commonly a gross one. But here is enough to take a taste of him;
to have observed all, were to have swelled a volume, and have made you
pay as dear for a fool's picture, as you have done for his tragedy with
sculptures.</p>

<p>As if incense could carry up thoughts, or a thought go up in smoke:
he may as well say, he will roast or bake thoughts, as smoke them. And
the allusion too is very agreeable and natural: he compares thunder,
lightning, and roaring of guns, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
incense; and says thus,&mdash;he expresses his loud joys
in a concert of thundering guns, as men send up silent vows in gentle
incense. If this description is not plentifully supplied with nonsense,
I will refer myself to the reader. No doubt it was worth our poet's
pains to cut a river up to Morocco, for the sake of such a description
of ships as this. A rare and studied piece it is. The poet has employed
his art about every line, that it may be esteemed a curiosity in its
kind, and himself a person endowed with a peculiar talent in writing
new and exact nonsense. And for this no doubt it was, that our poet was
so much courted, sent for from place to place, that you could hardly
cross a street but you met him puffing and blowing, with his fardel of
nonsense under his arm, driving his bulls in haste to some great person
or other to shew them, as if he had lately come out of Asia or Africa
with strange kinds of dromedaries, rhinoceroses, or a new Cambyses, a
beast more monstrous than any of the former. Nay, both the playhouses
contended for him, as if he had found out some new way of eating fire. No
doubt their design was to entertain the town with a rarity. People had
been long weary of good sense that looked like nonsense, and now they
would treat them with nonsense which yet looked very like sense. But as
he that pretended he would shew a beast which was very like a horse, and
was no horse, set people much admiring what strange animal it should
be, but when they came in, and found it was nothing but a plain grey
mare, laughed a while at the conceit, but were ready after to stone the
fellow for his impudence; so it must needs fare with our poet, when his
upper-gallery fools discover they have tricks put upon them, and all that
they have so ignorantly clapped is downright nonsense. And for my part,
I cannot but admire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
that not only to those who know, or at least have had time enough to
learn, what sense is, but also to a people who, of all nations in the
world, pretend to understand best what belongs to shipping, our poet
should dare to offer this fustian for sense and a description of ships;
a description so ridiculous, that Mulylabas, as errant a fool, and as
ignorant of ships as he is, must needs discover, that he is abused, and
that ships cannot be such things as the poet makes them. But the poet has
not only been so impudent to expose all this stuff, but so arrogant to
defend it with an Epistle; like a saucy booth-keeper, that when he had
put a cheat upon the people, would wrangle and fight with any that would
not like it, or would offer to discover it; for which arrogance our poet
receives this correction; and to jerk him a little the sharper, I will
not transpose his verse, but by the help of his own words trans-nonsense
sense, that, by my stuff, people may judge the better what his is:</p>

<p class="p4">POSTSCRIPT.</p>

<p>Some who are pleased with the bare sound of verse, or the rumbling
of robustious nonsense, will be apt to think Mr Settle too severely
handled in this pamphlet; but I do assure the reader, that there are a
vast number of errors passed by, perhaps as many, or more, than are taken
notice of, both to avoid the tediousness of the work, and the greatness.
It might have occasioned a volume upon such a trifle. I dare affirm,
that no objections in this book are fruitless cavils: but if, through
too much haste, Mr Settle may be accused of any seeming fault, which may
reasonably be defended, let the passing by many gross errors without
reprehension compound for it. I am not ignorant, that his admirers, who
most commonly are women, will resent this very ill; and some little
friends of his, who are smatterers in poetry, will be ready for most of
his gross errors to use that much mistaken plea of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">poetica licentia</i>,
which words fools are apt to use for the palliating the most absurd
nonsense in any poem. I cannot find when poets had liberty, from any
authority, to write nonsense, more than any other men. Nor is that plea
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">poetica licentia</i> used as a subterfuge by any but weak professors of
that art, who are commonly given over to a mist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
fancy, a buzzing of invention, and a sound of something like sense, and
have no use of judgment. They never think thoroughly, but the best of
their thoughts are like those we have in dreams, imperfect; which though
perhaps we are often pleased with sleeping, we blush at waking. The
licentious wildness and extravagance of such men's conceits have made
poetry contemned by some, though it be very unjust for any to condemn the
science for the weakness of some of the professors.</p>

<p>Men that are given over to fancy only, are little better than madmen.
What people say of fire, viz. that it is a good servant, but an ill
master, may not unaptly be applied to fancy; which, when it is too
active, rages, but when cooled and allayed by the judgment, produces
admirable effects. But this rage of fancy is never Mr Settle's crime; he
has too much phlegm, and too little choler, to be accused of this. He has
all the pangs and throes of a fanciful poet, but is never delivered of
any more perfect issue of his phlegmatic brain, than a dull Dutchwoman's
sooterkin is of her body.</p>

<p>His style is very muddy, and yet much laboured; for his meaning (for
sense there is not much) is most commonly obscure, but never by reason
of too much height, but lowness. His fancy never flies out of sight,
but often sinks out of sight:&mdash;but now I hope the reader will
excuse some digression upon the extravagant use of fancy and poetical
licence.</p>

<p>Fanciful poetry and music, used with moderation, are good; but men who
are wholly given over to either of them, are commonly as full of whimsies
as diseased and splenetic men can be. Their heads are continually hot,
and they have the same elevation of fancy sober, which men of sense have
when they drink. So wine used moderately does not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
away the judgment, but used continually, debauches men's understandings,
and turns them into sots, making their heads continually hot by accident,
as the others are by nature; so, mere poets and mere musicians are as
sottish as mere drunkards are, who live in a continual mist, without
seeing or judging any thing clearly.</p>

<p>A man should be learned in several sciences, and should have a
reasonable, philosophical, and in some measure a mathematical head, to be
a complete and excellent poet; and besides this, should have experience
in all sorts of humours and manners of men; should be thoroughly skilled
in conversation, and should have a great knowledge of mankind in general.
Mr Settle having never studied any sort of learning but poetry, and that
but slenderly, as you may find by his writings, and having besides no
other advantages, must make very lame work on't; he himself declares,
he neither reads, nor cares for conversation; so that he would persuade
us he is a kind of fanatic in poetry, and has a light within him, and
writes by an inspiration; which (like that of the heathen prophets) a man
must have no sense of his own when he receives; and no doubt he would
be thought inspired, and would be reverenced extremely in the country
where Santons are worshipped. But some will, I doubt not, object, that
poetry should not be reduced to the strictness of mathematics; to which
I answer, it ought to be so far mathematical as to have likeness and
proportion, since they will all confess that it is a kind of painting.
But they will perhaps say, that a poem is a picture to be seen at a
distance, and therefore ought to be bigger than the life. I confess there
must be a due distance allowed for the seeing of any thing in the world;
for an object can no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
be seen at all too near, than too far off the eye: but granting that a
poem is a picture to be viewed at a great distance, the distance and
the bigness ought to be so suited, as though the picture be much bigger
than the life, yet it must not seem so; and what miserable mistakes some
poets make for want of knowing this truly, I leave to men of sense to
judge; and by the way, let us consider that dramatic poetry, especially
the English, brings the picture nearer the eye, than any other sort of
poetry.</p>

<p>But some will say after this, what licence is left for poets?
Certainly the same that good poets ever took, without being faulty,
(for surely the best were so sometimes, because they were but men,)
and that licence is fiction; which kind of poetry is like that of
landscape-painting; and poems of this nature, though they be not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera</i>,
ought to be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">verisimilia</i>.</p>

<p>The great art of poets is either the adorning and beautifying of
truth, or the inventing pleasing and probable fictions. If they invent
impossible fables, like some of Æsop's, they ought to have such morals
couched under them, as may tend to the instruction of mankind, or the
regulation of manners, or they can be of no use; nor can they really
delight any but such as would be pleased with Tom Thumb, without these
circumstances. But there are some pedants, who will quote authority from
the ancients for the faults and extravagancies of some of the moderns;
who being able to imitate nothing but the faults of the classic authors,
mistake them for their excellencies. I speak with all due reverence to
the ancients; for no man esteems their perfections more than myself,
though I confess I have not that blind implicit faith in them which some
ignorant schoolmasters would impose upon us, to believe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
all their errors, and own all their crimes: to some pedants every thing
in them is of that authority, that they will create a new figure of
rhetoric out of the fault of an old poet. I am apt to believe the same
faults were found in them, when they wrote, which men of sense find now;
but not the excellencies which schoolmasters would persuade us: yet I
must say now,</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This play was written by John Dryden, our author's second son, and
is said to have been founded on a real incident which happened at Rome.
It was dedicated to Sir Robert Howard, the author's uncle, and acted in
1696, with the advantages of a Prologue from Congreve, and an Epilogue
from our author.</i> See Vol. X. p. 423.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="first drop">I</span> <span class="smcap">have</span> thought convenient to acquaint the reader with somewhat
concerning this comedy, though perhaps not worth his knowledge. It was
sent me from Italy some years since, by my second son, to try its fortune
on the stage; and being the essay of a young unexperienced author, to
confess the truth, I thought it not worthy of that honour. It is true,
I was not willing to discourage him so far, as to tell him plainly my
opinion, but it seems he guessed somewhat of my mind, by my long delays
of his expectation; and therefore, in my absence from the town last
summer, took the boldness to dedicate his play to that person of honour
whose name you will find before his Epistle. It was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
by that noble gentleman with so much candour and generosity, as neither
my son nor I could deserve from him. Then the play was no longer in my
power; the patron demanding it in his own right, it was delivered to
him: and he was farther pleased, during my sickness, to put it into that
method in which you find it; the loose scenes digested into order, and
knit into a tale.</p>

<p>As it is, I think it may pass amongst the rest of
our new plays: I know but two authors, and they
are both my friends,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> who have done better since
the Revolution. This I dare venture to maintain, that the taste of the
age is wretchedly depraved in all sorts of poetry; nothing almost but
what is abominably bad can please. The young hounds, who ought to come
behind, now lead the pack; but they miserably mistake the scent. Their
poets, worthy of such an audience, know not how to distinguish their
characters; the manners are all alike inconsistent, and interfering with
each other. There is scarce a man or woman of God's making in all their
farces, yet they raise an unnatural sort of laughter, the common effect
of buffoonery; and the rabble, which takes this for wit, will endure no
better, because it is above their understanding. This account I take from
the best judges; for I thank God, I have had the grace hitherto to avoid
the seeing or reading of their gallimaufries. But it is the latter end of
a century, and I hope the next will begin better.</p>

<p>This play, I dare assure the reader, is none of those; it may want
beauties, but the faults are neither gross, nor many. Perfection in any
art is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
not suddenly obtained: the author of this, to his misfortune, left his
country at a time when he was to have learned the language. The story
he has treated, was an accident which happened at Rome, though he has
transferred the scene to England. If it shall please God to restore him
to me, I may perhaps inform him better of the rules of writing; and if
I am not partial, he has already shewn that a genius is not wanting to
him. All that I can reasonably fear is, that the perpetual good success
of ill plays may make him endeavour to please by writing worse, and by
accommodating himself to the wretched capacity and liking of the present
audience, from which heaven defend any of my progeny! A poet, indeed,
must live by the many; but a good poet will make it his business to
please the few. I will not proceed farther on a subject which arraigns so
many of the readers.</p>

<p>For what remains, both my son and I are extremely obliged to my dear
friend, Mr Congreve, whose excellent Prologue was one of the greatest
ornaments of the play. Neither is my Epilogue the worst which I have
written; though it seems, at the first sight, to expose our young clergy
with too much freedom. It was on that consideration that I had once begun
it otherwise, and delivered the copy of it to be spoken, in case the
first part of it had given offence. This I will give you, partly in my
own justification, and partly too because I think it not unworthy of your
sight; only remembering you, that the last line connects the sense to the
ensuing part of it.&mdash;Farewell, reader: if you are a father, you will
forgive me; if not, you will when you are a father.</p>

of Monmouth of his family, is one of the most heroic characters,
according to ancient ideas of heroism, which occur in English history.
Under every disadvantage of want of money, and provisions,
and men, from England, of the united opposition of France, and
almost all Spain, and of the untoward and untractable disposition
of Charles of Austria, he had almost placed that prince upon the
Spanish throne, in defiance of all opposition, as well as of Charles's
own imprudence. With an army, which never amounted to 10,000
men, he drove triple the number out of Spain before him; and,
had he not been removed by a wretched intrigue, he would have
secured the kingdom, which he had effectually conquered. Like
other heroes, he was attached to literature, and especially to poetry;
and the conqueror of Spain was the patron of Dryden, and
the friend of Swift, Pope, and Gay. He was a keen Whig, but
not in favour with his party. "It is a perfect jest," says Swift,
in a letter to Archbishop King, 5th February, 1707-8, "to see
my Lord Peterborough, reputed as great a Whig as any man in
England, abhorred by his own party, and caressed by the Tories."
This great man died at Lisbon, 1737, aged seventy-seven.</p></div>

statesmen, who, amidst the fatigues of state, have found leisure
to cultivate the Muses. He had been ambassador to France and
Constantinople; and, in 1695, was raised to the high situation
mentioned in the text. In 1697, he resigned his employments,
and retired to East Hamstead, in Berkshire, where he early distinguished
the youthful genius of Pope. During the remaining
years of Sir William's life, the young bard and the old statesman
were almost inseparable companions.</p></div>

He was bred a Catholic; but renounced the tenets of Rome during the
time of the Popish plot. Previous to the Revolution, he had so strong
a sense of the necessity of that measure, that he mortgaged his estate
for 40,000l. and retired into Holland, for the purpose of offering his
fealty, and sword, to the Prince of Orange. Accordingly, when that great
enterprize succeeded, he was advanced to the ducal dignity, and loaded
with office and honours. In 1700, the Duke went upon the Continent for
his health; and, on his return, finding the Whigs disgusted at his having
married a foreign lady, having visited Rome, and, above all, having
declined to enter actively into their measures, he joined the Tories;
he assisted in bringing about the peace of Utrecht, being appointed
ambassador extraordinary for that purpose; and, finally, went to Ireland
as lord-lieutenant. He died 1st February, 1717-18.&mdash;Mackay, or
Davis, gives him the following character.</p>

<p>"Never was a greater mixture of honour, virtue, [<i>none</i>] and good
sense, in any one person, than in him. A great man, attended with a
sweetness of behaviour and easiness of conversation, <em>which charms
all</em> who come near him: Nothing of the stiffness of a statesman,
yet the capacity and knowledge of a piercing wit. He speaks French and
Italian as well as his native language: and, although but one eye, yet he
has a very charming countenance, and is the most generally beloved by the
ladies of any gentleman in his time. He is turned of forty years old."</p>

<p>The little word <em>none</em>, within the crotchets, is inserted by
Swift. That wit elsewhere describes the duke "as a person of admirable
qualities; and, if he were somewhat more active, and less timorous in
business, no man would be thought comparable to him."&mdash;<cite>Letter to
Archbishop King, 20th May, 1712.</cite></p></div>

to the niggard disposition of this bookseller, we owe that the notes,
as here acknowledged, were rather slurred over, than written with
due care: "I am not sorry that you will not allow any thing towards

half a year's time at least. Those I write shall be only marginal,
to help the unlearned, who understand not the poetical fables.
The Prefaces, as I intend them, will be somewhat more learned.
It would require seven years to translate Virgil exactly; but, I

find all of your trade are sharpers, and you not more than others;
therefore, I have not wholly left you. Mr Aston does not blame
you for getting as good a bargain as you could, though I could
have got a hundred pounds more; and you might have spared
almost all your trouble, if you had thought fit to publish the proposals
for the first subscriptions, for I have guineas offered me
every day, if there had been room; I believe, modestly speaking,
I have refused already twenty-five. I mislike nothing in your

he became, unfortunately for himself and his patron, a favourite
of the Duke of Monmouth, and engaged deeply in all his
intrigues, particularly in that of the Rye-house plot, on the discovery
of which he fled to Holland, of which he was a native:
nevertheless, he was there seized and delivered. He was tried by
Jefferies; and sustained the brutality of that judge with more

find in a subsequent note, acting as Mulgrave's second, in an intended
duel with Rochester. If this be so, from the slight with
which he is here mentioned, there may have been a coolness in
their friendship, although, indeed, the mere want of <em>morals</em> was
not considered as an insufferable stigma in the reign of Charles II.,

of Portsmouth. Neither was supposed over-scrupulous in fidelity
to their royal lover. The Duchess of Cleveland, in particular,
lavished her favours even upon Jacob Hall, the rope-dancer;
at least, so Count Hamilton assures us, in the "Memoirs
of Grammont." The Duchess of Portsmouth was a pensioner
of the French court; by whom she was thrown into the
arms of Charles, with the express purpose of securing his attachment
to the cause of France. Charles knew, as well as any of his
subjects, the infidelity of one mistress, and the treachery of the
other; and Sheffield has elsewhere vindicated the epithet of
"sauntering," which is here bestowed on that indolent monarch.
"I am of opinion," says the duke, "that, in his latter times,
there was as much of laziness as of love in all those hours he passed
among his mistresses; who, after all, only served to fill up his
seraglio, while a bewitching kind of pleasure, called <i>sauntering</i>,

in."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> While Sheffield thus solemnly confirms, in prose, the
character given of Charles in the "Essay upon Satire," he ascertains
his claim to the property of the poem. And I must add, I
should be sorry to think Dryden was accessary to lampooning persons,
to whom he had offered the incense of his verse. See the

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> This was Arthur, first Earl of Essex of his name. He was
son of that Lord Capel, who so gallantly defended Colchester
during the civil wars, and was executed upon the place being
taken. Lord Essex had been lieutenant of Ireland from 1672 to
1677, and was supposed to have fixed his ambition upon returning
to that situation. Being disappointed, he joined in the measures
of Shaftesbury and Monmouth, and was a violent opponent
of the court. He was committed to the Tower on account of his
accession to the Rye-house plot; and, upon the morning on which
Lord Russel was conveyed to his trial, he was found with his throat
cut, the King and Duke of York being in the Tower at the
very time, to witness some experiment on the ordnance. It was afterwards
asserted, that he had been murdered by order of the court.
Even Burnet, however, seems to acquit them of the crime, both
because Essex was a free-thinker, and accustomed to vindicate
suicide, and because his surgeon declared to him, that, from the
mode in which the wound was inflicted, it could only have been
done with his own hand. But the violent proceedings against
Braddon and Speke, who attempted to investigate this mysterious
affair, threw some suspicion upon the court party. If Charles
was accessary to the murder, the time was strangely chosen, and
the king's dissimulation equally remarkable; for, on hearing the
event, be exclaimed, "Alas! Lord Essex might have trusted my
clemency, I owed his family a life."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> No one could know the cowardice of Lord Rochester so well
as Mulgrave, who, in his Memoirs, records the following infamous
instance of it. He had heard it reported, that Lord Rochester
had said something of him very malicious: "I therefore sent Colonel
Aston, a very mettled friend of mine, to call him to account
for it. He denied the words; and, indeed, I was soon convinced
he had never said them: but the mere report, though I found
it to be false, obliged me (as I then foolishly thought) to go
on with the quarrel; and the next day was appointed for us to
fight on horseback, a way in England a little unusual, but it
was his part to chuse. Accordingly, I and my second lay the
night before at Knightsbridge, privately, to avoid the being secured
at London upon any suspicion; which yet we found ourselves
more in danger of there, because we had all the appearance
of highway-men, that had a mind to lie skulking in an odd
inn for one night; but this, I suppose, the people of that house
were used to, and so took no notice of us, but liked us the better.
In the morning, we met the Lord Rochester at the place appointed,
who, instead of James Porter, whom, he assured Aston, he
would make his second, brought an errant lifeguard-man, whom
nobody knew. To this Mr Aston took exception, upon the account
of his being no suitable adversary; especially considering
how extremely well he was mounted, whereas we had only a couple
of pads. Upon which, we all agreed to fight on foot: But, as
my Lord Rochester and I were riding into the next field, in order
to it, he told me, that he had at first chosen to fight on horseback,
because he was so weak with a distemper, that he found himself
unfit to fight at all any way, much less a-foot. I was extremely
surprised, because, at that time, no man had a better reputation
for courage; and (my anger against him being quite over, because
I was satisfied that he never spoke those words I resented,) I
took the liberty of representing, what a ridiculous story it would
make if we returned without fighting; and therefore advised him,
for both our sakes, especially for his own, to consider better of it;
since I must be obliged, in my own defence, to lay the fault
on him, by telling the truth of the matter. His answer was, that
he submitted to it; and hoped, that I would not desire the advantage
of having to do with any man in so weak a condition.
I replied, that, by such an argument, he had sufficiently tied
my hands, upon condition I might call our seconds to be witnesses
of the whole business; which he consented to, and so we
parted. When we returned to London, we found it full of this
quarrel, upon our being absent so long; and therefore Mr Aston
thought himself obliged to write down every word and circumstance
of this whole matter, in order to spread every where the
true reason of our returning without having fought; which being
never in the least either contradicted or resented by the Lord Rochester,
entirely ruined his reputation as to courage, (of which I
was really sorry to be the occasion,) though no body had still a
greater as to wit; which supported him pretty well in the world,
notwithstanding some more accidents of the same kind, that never
fail to succeed one another when once people know a man's weakness."&mdash;<cite>Memoirs
of Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham.</cite></p>

<p>Conscious of his infamy, Rochester only ventured to reply to
Sheffield, the real author of the above satire, by some cold sneers
on his expedition to Tangiers, which occur in the poem called
"Rochester's Farewell."</p></div>

does not apply to Thomas Randolph, whose pastorals are
rather ornate, and duly garnished with classical names; witness
a dialogue between Tityrus and Alexis, "occasioned by two doctors
disputing on predestination." Still less do I think Robert
Randal was the person intended, whom Ritson has introduced
among the English poets, in virtue of his "Woeful Song," and
his "Woeful and Sorrowful Complaint," licensed two days after
the execution of his son and him, at St Thomas-a-Waterings, 21st
February, 1593. Probably Dryden, if he filled up this name,
was contented to speak at large, from a general recollection, that
Thomas Randolph, the adopted son of Ben Jonson, had written
pastorals. The corresponding author named by Boileau, is Pierre
Ronsard, who, in singing of Henry and Charles of France, degraded
them into Henriot and Carlin.</p></div>

or religious plays, (still, I believe, acted in some parts of Flanders,)
is extracted from a lively and popular miscellany. "It is generally
allowed, that pilgrims introduced these devout spectacles. Those who
returned from the Holy-Land, or rather consecrated places, composed
canticles of their travels, and amused their religious fancies by
interweaving scenes, of which Christ, the apostles, and other objects
of devotion, served as the themes. Menestrier informs us, that these
pilgrims travelled in troops, and stood in the public streets, where
they recited their poems, with their staff in hand; while their chaplets
and cloaks, covered with shells and images of various colours, formed
a picturesque exhibition, which at length excited the piety of the
citizens to erect, occasionally, a stage on an extensive spot of ground.
These spectacles served as the amusement and instruction of the people.
So attractive were these gross exhibitions in the dark ages, that they
formed one of the principal ornaments of the reception which was given
to princes when they entered towns."&mdash;<cite>D'Israeli's Curiosities of

<p>Prior gives the following account of the matter. "In the first Dutch war, he
went a volunteer with the Duke of York: his behaviour during that campaign
was such, as distinguished the Sackvill, descended from that Hildebrand of
the name, who was one of the greatest captains that came into England with
the Conqueror. But his making a song the night before the engagement, and
it is one of the prettiest that ever was made, carries with it so sedate a presence
of mind, and such an unusual gallantry, that it deserves as much to be
recorded as Alexander's jesting with his soldiers before he past the Granicus,
or William the First of Orange giving order over night for a battle, and
desiring to be called in the morning, lest he should happen to sleep too
long."</p></div>

of Howard, occurs in Sir Robert's own preface, who points out
an additional advantage attending it. He observes, that the subjects
of the ancients were usually the most known stories and fables; a
circumstance which led them to compose their plays rather of
speeches and chorus's, than of scenic action, and representation:
Because, "Seneca making choice of Medea, Hippolytus, and
Hercules &OElig;tus, it was impossible to show Medea throwing the
mangled limbs of Jason into her age-renewing kettle, or to present
the scattered limbs of Hippolytus upon the stage, or show
Hercules burning upon his own funeral pile."</p></div>

see much merit in the plot of "The Bloody Brother, or Rollo" of Fletcher.
The hero is a Duke of Normandy, who first kills his brother in his

the dogs; beheads his tutor, kills an officer of his guards for burying
the reliques of his chancellor, and finally is stabbed by the captain of
his guards, and succeeded in his dukedom by his cousin; a person of no
note through the play, but who, being left alive when every other person
is killed, is raised to the throne as a matter of necessity. This is the
history of Geta and Caracalla, and a very disagreeable one it is, but
certainly not the plot of a play. As for the farce mingled with it, there

honourable Edward Howard, author of the "British Princes,"
who, in the preface to the "Woman's Conquest," has this passage:
"And here I cannot chuse but reflect on our mean imitation of
French plays, by introducing of servants and waiting-women to
have parts, without being essential characters; an error well
avoided by our former writers, who never admitted any otherwise
than as messengers and attendants, except on the account of being
characters, as is to be seen by Numphs in "Bartholomew Fair,"
and Face in the "Alchymist;" the latter of which (notwithstanding
what can be objected against him) may deservedly be granted
one of the best parts on our English stage." But the passage does
not quite correspond with the sentiment in the text; besides, the
"Woman's Conquest" did not appear till 1670-1, two years after
the Essay. The preface contains some oblique attacks upon
Dryden.</p></div>

which in the "Session of Poets" he is censured by Apollo; Diego is
described, in the characters of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>, as "servant

canter of these doggrel Alexandrines. The old comedy of
"Gammer Gurton's Needle" is composed entirely of them.
Shakespeare often uses them where the dialogue is carried on by
his clowns, or comic characters; as in "Love's Labour's Lost," act
III.; in most of the quaint skirmishes of wit and punning, in the
"Comedy of Errors;" and in the "Taming of the Shrew." Other
examples from low comedy of that early age are given in Reed's
edition of Shakespeare, Vol. xx. p. 462. After all, this same
Alexandrine is only the common ballad-stanza of "Chevy Chace,"
written in two lines at length, instead of being subdivided into
four. Mr Malone remarks, that the assertion in the text is too
general.</p></div>

decision, proves the miserable taste of the age. In fact, Jonson,
by dint of learning and arrogance, fairly bullied the age into receiving
his own character of his merits; and he was not the only
person of the name that has done so.</p></div>

library</i>, and Clarendon pronounces the least man and greatest
scholar of his time. Gildon tells the anecdote to which Dryden
seems to allude, in an essay addressed to Dryden himself on the
vindication of Shakespeare, and he quotes our author as his authority.
"The matter of fact, if my memory fail me not, was
this: Mr Hales of Eton affirmed, that he would show all the
poets of antiquity out-done by Shakespeare, in all the topics and
common places made use of in poetry. The enemies of Shakespeare
would by no means yield him so much excellence; so that
it came to a resolution of a trial of skill upon that subject. The
place agreed on for the dispute, was Mr Hales's chamber at Eton.
A great many books were sent down by the enemies of this poet;
and on the appointed day, my Lord Falkland, Sir John Suckling,
and all the persons of quality that had wit and learning, and interested
themselves in the quarrel, met there; and upon a thorough
disquisition of the point, the judges chosen by agreement out of
this learned and ingenious assembly, unanimously gave the preference
to Shakespeare; and the Greek and Roman poets were
adjudged to veil at least their glory in that to the English hero."

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> The reasons against rhyme,&mdash;and very weighty our author at
last found them,&mdash;are taken from the Preface to Sir Robert Howard's
plays, the Crites of the dialogue.</p>

<p>"Another way of the ancients, which the French follow, and our
stage has now lately practised, is, to write in rhyme; and this
is the dispute betwixt many ingenious persons, whether verse in
rhyme, or verse without the sound, which may be called <em>blank</em>
verse, (though a hard expression,) is to be preferred. But take
the question largely, and it is never to be decided; but, by right
application, I suppose it may; for in the general, they are both
proper, that is, one for a play, the other for a poem or copy of
verses; a blank verse being as much too low for one, as rhyme is
unnatural for the other. A poem, being a premeditated form of
thoughts upon designed occasions, ought not to be unfurnished
of any harmony in words or sound; the other is presented as the
present effect of accidents not thought of: so that it is impossible
it should be equally proper to both these, unless it were possible
that all persons were born so much more than poets, that verses
were not to be composed by them, but already made in them.
Some may object, that this argument is trivial, because, whatever
is shewed, it is known still to be but a play; but such may as well
excuse an ill scene, that is not naturally painted, because they
know it is only a scene, and not really a city or country.</p>

<p>"But there is yet another thing which makes verse upon the
stage appear more unnatural; that is, when a piece of a verse is
made up by one that knew not what the other meant to say, and
the former verse answered as perfectly in sound as the last is supplied
in measure; so that the smartness of a reply, which has its
beauty by coming from sudden thoughts, seems lost by that which
rather looks like a design of two, than the answer of one. It may
be said, that rhyme is such a confinement to a quick and luxuriant
fancy, that it gives a stop to its speed, till slow judgment comes
in to assist it; but this is no argument for the question in hand:
for the dispute is not, which way a man may write best in, but
which is most proper for the subject he writes upon; and, if this
were let pass, the argument is yet unsolved in itself: for he that
wants judgment in the liberty of his fancy, may as well shew the
defect of it in its confinement: and, to say truth, he that has
judgment will avoid the errors, and he that wants it will commit
them both. It may be objected, it is improbable that any should
speak <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">extempore</i> as well as Beaumont and Fletcher makes them,
though in blank verse: I do not only acknowledge that, but that
it is also improbable any will write so well that way. But if that
may be allowed improbable, I believe it may be concluded impossible
that any should speak as good verses in rhyme, as the best
poets have writ; and therefore, that which seems nearest to what
it intends, is ever to be preferred. Nor is great thoughts more
adorned by verse, than verse unbeautified by mean ones; so that
verse seems not only unfit in the best use of it, but much more in
the worse, when a servant is called, or a door bid to be shut, in
rhyme. Verses (I mean good ones) do in their height of fancy
declare the labour that brought them forth, like majesty, that
grows with care; and Nature, that made the poet capable, seems
to retire, and leave its offers to be made perfect by pains and judgement.
Against this I can raise no argument but my Lord of
Orrery's writings, in whose verse the greatness of the majesty
seems unsullied with the cares, and his inimitable fancy descends
to us in such easy expressions, that they seem as if neither had
ever been added to the other, but both together flowing from a
height; like birds got so high, that use no labouring wings, but
only with an easy care preserve a steadiness in motion. But this
particular happiness, among those multitudes which that excellent
person is owner of, does not convince my reason, but employ my
wonder: yet I am glad such verse has been written for our stage,
since it has so happily exceeded those whom we seemed to imitate.
But while I give these arguments against verse, I may seem faulty
that I have not only written ill ones, but written any: but, since
it was the fashion, I was resolved, as in all indifferent things, not
to appear singular, the danger of the vanity being greater than the
error; and therefore I followed it as a fashion, though very far
off."</p></div>

profession of a waterman, was, according to Wood, a man who,
having a prodigious <em>genie</em> to poetry, wrote eighty books, which
not only made much sport at the time, but were thought worthy
of being remitted into a large folio. He was a staunch cavalier,
which might in some degree bribe Anthony's judgment of his
poetry. His poetry is very like that which Skelton wrote a century
before him. Among other pieces, there are some comical
addresses to his subscribers, whom he divides into those who had received
and paid their books; those who had done neither; and those
who, having received, were unable to pay. To the first class he
abounds in gratitude; the second he addresses as between hope
and despair; the third he treats civilly, as they were defaulters from
inability, and had always given him plenty of sack and fair promises:
But, as was reason, he reserves the extremity of his displeasure
for a fourth class of subscribers, who, having received his
books, refused to pay the subscription.</p></div>

pleasing effect of the plays, which he censures, to the lively representation.
"Amongst those who will be objecting against the doctrine
I lay down, may peradventure appear a sort of men who have
remembered so and so; and value themselves upon their experience.
I may write by the book (say they) what I have a mind,
but they know what will please. Those are a kind of stage-quacks
and empirics in poetry, who have got a receipt to please; and no
collegiate like them for purging the passions.</p>

<p>"These say (for instance) a "King and no King" pleases. I
say the comical part pleases.</p>

<p>"I say that Mr Hart pleases; most of the business falls to his
share, and what he delivers, every one takes upon content; their
eyes are prepossessed and charmed by his action, before aught of
the poet's can approach their ears; and to the most wretched of
characters, he gives a lustre and brilliance, which dazzles the sight,
that the deformities in the poetry cannot be perceived."&mdash;<cite>Remarks</cite>,
p. 5.</p>

<p>He has a similar observation in page 138:&mdash;"We may remember,
however we find this scene of Melantius and Amintor
written in the book, that at the theatre we have a good scene acted.
There is work cut out, and both our Æsopus and Roscius
are on the stage together: whatever defect may be in Amintor
and Melantius, Mr Hart and Mr Mohun are wanting in nothing.
To these we owe for what is pleasing in the scene; and to this
scene we may impute the success of the "Maid's Tragedy."</p></div>

Here is like to be poetical justice, so many lives taken away, and

against the manner of our author's dedications. "The impudence of scribblers
in this age has so corrupted the original design of dedications, that before I
dare tell you this trifle begs your lordship's protection, I ought first to examine
on what grounds I make the attack; for now every thing that ere saw
the stage, how modest soever it has been there, without daring to shew its
face above three days, has yet the arrogance to thrust itself into the world in
print, with a great name before it: When the fawning scribbler shall compendiously
say,&mdash;The factions of critics, the ill time of the year, and the worse
acting of the players, has prejudiced his play; but he doubts not, but his
grace, or his honour's more impartial judgment will find that pardonable,
which the world has so maliciously censured; that is as much as to say,&mdash;Sir,
you are the only person at court, whose blind side I dare venture on; not
doubting, but your good nature will excuse what all the world (except the author)
has justly condemned. Thus a dedication, which was formerly a present
to a person of quality, is now made a libel on him; whilst the poet either supposes
his patron to be so great a sot to defend that in print, which he hist off
the stage; or else makes himself a greater, in asking a favour from him,
which he never expects to obtain. However, that which is abuse to the patron,
is a compliment to the bookseller, who whispers the poet, and tells him,
sir, your play had misfortune, and all that&mdash;but if you'd but write a dedication,
or preface.&mdash;The poet takes the hint, picks out a person of honour, tells
him he has a great deal of wit, gives us an account who writ sense in the last
age, supposing we cannot be ignorant who writes it in this; disputes the nature
of verse, answers a cavil or two, quibbles upon the court, huffs the critics,
and the work's done. 'Tis not to be imagined how far a sheet of this
goes to make a bookseller rich, and a poet famous.</p>

<p>"But, my lord, whilst I trouble you with this kind of discourse, I beg you
would not think I design to give rules to the press, as some of our tribe have
done to the stage; or that I find fault with their dedications, in compliment
to my own: no, that's a trick I do not pretend to."</p></div>

<p>"Thereupon, with very little conjuration, by those three remarkable qualities
of <em>railing</em>, <em>boasting</em>, and <em>thieving</em>, I found a Dryden in the frontispiece;
then going through the preface, I observed the drawing of a fool's picture to
be the design of the whole piece; and reflecting on the painter, I considered
that probably the pamphlet might be like his plays, not to be written without
help: and according to expectation, I discovered the author of "Epsom
Wells," and the author of "Pandion and Amphigenia," lent their assistance.
How! Three to one, thought I! and three gentlemen of such disagreeing
qualifications in one club! The first, a man that has had wit, but is past it;
the second, that has it, if he can keep it; and the third, that neither has, nor
is ever like to have it. Then boldly on I went, and fortified with patience
(as I found it required) for a full perusal, I wondered the less at the deformity
of the piece, when such different heads went to the composure. The first
of these is the only person that pretends an injury, received from a satiric
line or two in the "Epistle to Morocco;" and consequently I conclude him
the promoter of so ill-natured a retort. The second, I suppose only putting
his comical hand, to help forward with the mirth of so ridiculous a libel; and
the third, perhaps out of a vain glory of being in print, knowing himself to
be such a reptile in poetry, that he's beholding to lampoon for giving the
world to know that there is such a writer in being."</p></div>
